Because we need that information before I reach out to business travel to book the rooms, right? Yeah. And then the second email we need to ask about, we've had, have you like announced it, announced it yet? Or just like floated the idea? No, just floated the idea, subauthentic number. So, yeah, it hasn't been completely announced. So yeah, so we need two emails. One to the Central Florida leaders who wants to stay at the summit. The second one is to everyone announcing it. Okay, do you want me to work on the announcement one? Yeah, yeah, you can work on that. I just, I mean, I literally just did this for the GM Con like a couple days ago, so. Okay, yeah. And I definitely need to reach out to LulzC. I need to reach out to like all the partners to see if they could join at the panel. You did already? Not yet. Well, you just want to write an email to them or you want to call them? I'll probably call them first and then maybe send an official email. Okay. So what I did for GM Con, I did two things because I've done them both this week. One was an email, it was a, it was a announcement email and calendar invite. So it was kind of, it kind of glued together, right? So that way there was a placeholder already on their calendars for it. And then the second email that I literally just sent out was the one to the partners. So I also kind of did the same thing. Again, it's not like, it's for, it was for the corporate partners event. But I sent like a, like a, hey, hold this date, more info coming soon kind of thing. Okay. Just because I don't have, I mean for me, I don't really have it flushed out. Like you and I have your schedule flushed out. We don't really have corporate partners flushed out yet, but at least I was putting it like a notice for them. So I think once we, once you call and talk to those people, like you speak to the people that you want to be at the panel and they agree, then I can do like a calendar hold for them as well. Like for the actual like time. And then I think what we could do also is set up a Microsoft forms for each panel so they could submit their questions. Do you have another way of them submitting their questions? No, that's the same thing I did for GM Con last year. I did a form and had them submit questions to me. And then I went through the questions. I went through the questions with Peter first. Darren didn't want to know the questions. So like he, he actually had no idea what questions were coming that day, but Peter and I sorted through them first and like got rid of the questions that we didn't think were going to be valuable for, you know, so, but you and I can like go through the questions first and do that. But yeah. I don't mind sharing the question then with the partners before that day too. Before, okay. Yeah. So those are, those are pretty much all the things that we need to do for, for the summit. Which has all the panelists, okay, I'm just making notes on our, on our one note that you don't have to look at. Oh, there's one. Huh? Okay. All right. So you, you already have a template for those emails it looks like. Yes. Okay. All right. So I spoke to Marga. Well, let's start with transportation first. I spoke to Juliana and gave her the three times that we'll need pickups. I know I mentioned that earlier, but so I told her we'll need transportation to pick them up from the airport, transportation for the ride over to the ranch, and transportation to, to drop them off back at the airport. So she sent that over to the transportation department now, which is not under front office anymore. Gary, I believe, oversees it now. So just waiting for him to get back to me. You'll hear back from him next year. No, Juliana will make sure she's on it. Okay. I spoke to Marga. And she, of course, she loved the idea. She's like, yeah, it'd be really cool. So she's going to look at the activities that we could do, the evening activities. But what she was thinking is there is a, I think it's called the queen, the merry queen or something like that. A big- Kissimmee River Cruise, yep. So yeah. So she's like, why don't we just, why don't we for the first hour, because if they get there, say, at 3.30 or even three, we could take the first hour and just have them do activities on their own. Like I could set up ski and shoot. What is it called? Ski and shoot? Ski shooting. Ski shooting. And she mentioned something else, but she's like, yeah, let me look and see what evening activity I could make sure it's ready for you guys. And then we can talk more. But they could take the first, and she's like, most activities, 45 minutes. So we could have three, four activities, like you said, to pick from, and take the first hour to do that. And then merry queen, they normally do late evening cruise. So we could have one at 5.30 or even five, goes out for an hour, come back. So everyone is a part of it. And then at six, we eat dinner. I'm like, that's cool. Let me talk to her and see what the cost is. She think it's around $35 a head or $30 a head. But she's like, hold on, let me talk to them. Because this is employee, so let me see how much I could get the price down to. Okay. So that's the plan. So she's gonna come up with three or four activities that we could do in the evening. So when we get there, they do that first. And then they'll go on the merry queen cruise. And then from there, they will go have dinner. Okay, so what we'll do once she gives us those three activities is we can set up a Microsoft form. And we'll also send that out as a separate email. And we'll have everyone pick the activity they wanna do. That way Morgan has a headcount going into it, right? Because if you have, if so many people pick skeet shooting, they need multiple people out on the range to make sure that's happening. Or if they need to make sure they have 10 courses ready, right? So we can do a sign up so that way Morgan knows what's happening before we get there. Yeah. And I don't wanna tell them where we're going. I just would be like, hey, which one of these activities you would wanna do if they're available? Let's see. Well, maybe we don't have to. Ask Morgan, maybe she doesn't need a headcount prior to. Maybe we can do it as we're going down. Like when we get on the transportation to go down to the ranch, maybe we can do it then. You know what I mean? Yeah, we could. We could. You better stop giving everybody access to that document if you don't want them to know what you're doing. I, the only people that have access is you and Peter and Rob and Stacey. No, not even Stacey, it's just Peter, you. Well, I thought you shared it with like Juliana and them as well. I didn't. I didn't trust Juliana at all. I was supposed to, but I just give her the information over the phone. But her, I trust. I trust her not to send it to anyone. She won't. Not to tell anyone. Yeah. So the only person that have access is really, well, EB, I forgot to give it to EB, but it's really, it's just Peter. Peter, EB, and the front office owners, which is just me, you, whoever's in this owner group, I think it's just me, you, Kathleen, and someone else. But none of them has access right now. Okay. Okay, well, that makes sense then. We'll just wait. We'll do a sign up for the activities like when we're on our way. You can host the transportation and you can be like the host. No, I'm gonna drive in my car. You're gonna drive in your car and make all of them ride in transportation to the ranch? That is so rude. Yeah. Because I think the bus only holds like 25, right? Or something. That's enough for you to fit. You need somebody to provide entertainment on the shuttle. Who's gonna do that? What kind of entertainment? Like, fun facts, like, look this way. We're on our way to the ranch. Oh, fuck, that's definitely not me. I'll bring a frigging device and I'll bring like a frigging tablet and we could do quiz or something. Like, what's that thing called that I tried to remember the name yesterday? God damn it. Well, what is it? What are you talking about? I can't remember the name. We used to bring owners to the movie theater to do it. And we'll ask- Trivia. Trivia. I could create a hundred question trivia that has to do with everything from SOPs to FTC to everything. And I could have everyone pull out their phone and we use Tableau and have everyone answer, driving down. Not Tableau. Not Tableau. Kahoot. Kahoot. I could do that. Yeah, see, that could work. That means you gotta be on the fly. No. They're just doing it on their phone. So, it'll be good. Everything you love. All right. Is that it for... For the summit? Yes. Are we sending the calendar invite out first? And then you're sending the... Then you're sending the emails to central floor leaders about who wants to stay? What's the cadence in which we're doing this? Um, I don't think it really matters. I think the announcement need to go out first, right? So they know. And then maybe the email to the central floor leaders. Okay, so do you want me to work on doing that right now? Or do you want me to do it when you're done? Unless we... I know you have other things, right? That we wanted to go over, like, a few lists of things. I mean, we could just make this whole meeting at the front of the summit. But I know you had something else, like two other things. I did. I had org charts. Do you want to work on your org charts? And then we needed to call Scarlett and Kayla. Okay. We could do that. All right, let me stop this thing. I'm running a recording test.

They're under guest relations agent, but they do kind of like concierge slash build services duties. Right? Yeah. It's all basically roped into one. Yeah. Just into one role. Okay. All right. I'm just trying. I'm just trying to think, like, when we. When we assign the checklist for your property, if the bell services alone checklist is good enough or. The bell services. Alone, because. The bell service because the guest relations checklist does more concierge duties. So you're. I don't know if you got to see both of them. So while. Both of them can be. Applicable, the. One that makes the most sense is bell services. Perfect. All right. That's. That's actually a question that I had. Okay. That works. Thank you. My pleasure.","📅 **Meeting Overview**: The focus of the meeting was to clarify roles and responsibilities pertaining to guest relations and concierge/bell services duties and to determine the appropriate checklist for property assignments.

And I, you know, to me, it doesn't matter where I start. Okay. I prefer Tennessee over anywhere else, but I, I don't, you know, I don't have to start Tennessee as long as I make it there at some point. Yeah, I know she's got a lot of linen issues. She's got issues with Smokey and the bins and. Yeah, they're using more of our bins for storage than. Than anything else. And I know, you know, I know they're building that new office building out there and they're going to take over that. Yeah, we don't know all the full details and stuff on it, but, you know, I, to me, it's. I gotta get out to the other properties anyways and see them. So. Yeah, yeah, I mean, I, I normally try to go to the ones first that are having, you know, like, issues. Right. You might want to. I normally try to target those ones first. Small. I mean, small, not smoky. Yeah, Smokey, I was there maybe five months ago. Okay. So that's why I'm kind of leaving them for last. But. Yeah, well, I know. And, and I know Lisa was talking to me. She wants to go out and go with me just to introduce me, you know, to the teams and stuff out there. But, you know, like, like, like I told her as well, I don't mind going out with, you know, like, I did. I did the QA with field. Yeah. Range. Yeah. You know, so it was the first time I'd done a QA with him. I don't mind going to other properties with, you know, you or. Yeah, Evie, you know, as long as I get introduced to the team. And. Yeah, okay, hey, great. You go do your thing, I'll do mine. And yeah, you know, hey, they know we're together. They know we're, you know, we're out here and stuff. I, I got no problem going that way too. So. To be honest with you, the, the last national director, that was housekeeping. National director. Me and him used to travel together because. Okay. Yeah. So whenever we go somewhere, it would be me and him because it kind of makes sense, right? Because one of the. When it comes to housekeeping and front office, like, those two departments are probably the two departments that works closest together. So whenever we. We would go out, both of us will find out what issues they're having. And normally, you know how it is. Normally it's. It's front desk, it's housekeeping, it's front deck. So both of us will take that on and be like, okay, let's talk. Let's see how we could fix this. And then, you know, I normally come up with like, maybe they're missing some tools that I can give them, whether it's a report or whatever. And they're like, hey, this is, you know, so it normally works like we did the same thing. A few properties, we went and. And we always find where the pointing finger happens. And then we come in and we're like, yeah, let's. Let's fix this. Let's talk. So, and. And a lot of too, you know, your. Your medallion scores affect mine. Mine affect yours. Yeah, you know, indirectly, but directly. Yeah. You know. Yeah. And, you know, and like I told Ken yesterday, you know, I told Ken, I said, put me on all your RPM calls. If I make it, I make it. If I don't, at least, you know, we're. I'm on there with you, and if I need to support you on anything, if anything's going on, you know, what a specific one, the next one we tagged me on and say, I definitely need you on here. So they make sure we have that support. And I said, no problem. Right. So he added me on to all of his. So I'm on there, you know, with. With those as well. And, you know, like you said, I got no problem. You know, hey, if, if we travel together. Great. We travel together. Yeah. We go together. And that's something. We can talk. Lisa, you know, Peter, whoever about and say, hey, yeah, it makes sense, you know, to me. Yeah. You know, it's. It's that great partnership. Yeah. That we need to have, you know. Yeah. So are you. Do you have any like, like anything front office, housekeeping related now, concerns that anyone brought up? I know it's kind of early right now. You're still kind of getting to know the players, but. Yeah, no, it's. It's, you know, I spent some time with Orlando learning the system. So I was in learning system and kind of going from there, but it's, you know, just. It's nothing that stood out really bad that I said, man, I gotta go see Omar, you know, you know, and, and talk to them that way and stuff. And, you know, like you said, still out there seeing the players and, you know, meeting them, you know, and, and making sure, you know, we're all communicating. Right. Right. Once you start getting out there, I mean, there, There may be quite a few things that may come across your plate as it relates to front office. Right. There may be. You may have some team members saying that, hey, I don't have access to fdc. Right. That's probably one that you may hear now. FDC is the new front office PMS system that we're using at the front desk. And a few months ago, we rolled out phase two to all the properties. Some properties were on phase one. Most properties were still on the old system called Mr. So you'll hear those terms Mr. And FDC. If someone asks you about getting access, there's quite a few things that you need to know and how to respond. So if they had Mr. In the past and they were using it and they still kind of. Because Mr. Is still there, we still have to use Mr. To do certain things like booking, reservation, and so on. Right. Because we're still working on that. But if they, if they had Mr. Access in the past and it still still active, then it's. We can. I. You can send me their name or they can email me and I could get them access to FDC. However, if they've never had a system access or Mr. Mr. Access in the past, then they need to submit a system access before they can get FDC access. All right? So that may come up. When you visit some of these properties, especially some of the supervisors and so on, they're like, hey, I don't have access and how do I get access? But that's, that's the process and how to get access. And everyone should know how to go into like the service request and submit access to get system access. So that's how they get the Mr. SAMs access. They need that first, that system access before they could get granted into the Mr. Access. So that, that, that may come up once you go with them. But other than that, I mean, I, I don't. I can't think of anything else that, you know, there's always going to be stuff coming up, but this is probably the one that has been coming just because we, we rolled it out a few months ago, and some of them still don't have access. Even though you give them the instructions like, hey, you need to get this done. They're still saying that I don't have access. But you've got to follow the process, right? You got to get the system access before we could grant you access to the system. And that's just kind of how it works. Yeah. Where you, where are you traveling to next? I haven't decided. I'm going to take this week and figure it out. But it's between Brunswoods. No, I think I'm gonna do out far out first because I, I just finished the Vegas side up west, like Park City, Vegas and Pitten Mountain. So I think I'm, I think I may do Williamsburg and Myrtle beach because they're close by. Okay. Yeah. So I'll probably fly into either Williamsburg or Myrtle beach and then fly from there to the other one, then fly back home because they're, they're like an hour apart rather than flying back home and then going back again. Okay, yeah, well, let me know. Let's, let's talk to Lisa. And like I said, I don't mind as long as I'm going with someone. I'm just not going into a property, you know. Yeah, I don't mind going in and, you know, and if we travel together. We travel together. Yeah. I mean, if she wants to travel with you to do the introduction and then after that, then that's fine. But. Yeah, but I mean, normally you just let Valerie, you, normally you pick the date when you're going. And I get it. You're, you're new, so she may want to do the introduction, but normally you just pick the date, let Valeria know, she'll book it. Honestly, I, I, I do. I don't do the booking, but I, I look up the ticket myself, the dates, everything, and I'll just tell Valeria, hey, this is the flight. This is what it is. And then she book it. Right. But I look up everything in the back end and just send it to him like, hey, this is the day I'm going. This is the time. This is the flight and all that. And then she'll, she'll do the booking. But, yeah, and I might just tell her that, you know, that's what I would do because I know Peter keeps pushing, pushing, pushing. You got to get out there. You got to get out there. You got to get up. Yeah. You know, and, and I, you know, and I definitely want to get out there, too, and start meeting them. And. Yeah, yeah, I got, I got my national call on Friday, but I want to make sure I'm out of business properties. I got, I got Williamsburg right now looking for shampoo machine that's, you know, $2500. And I told him, hold on a second, guys, listen. Oh, wow. Yeah, yeah. So I can find something cheaper, but it's, you know, why are you doing this? What's going, you know, and I want to make sure I'm there to support them and not just say, no, we're not going to buy this. We're going to find something else for them. You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. And, you know, help them. Help them understand that. So. Yeah, I guess, you know, once. Once you find something and, you know, you find dates where you're going, just let me know. And I. I'll go with Bolero and we'll. We'll book together and go together. Yeah, yeah. And stuff. And I think. I think that'll help Lisa out too, because she is. She's bombarded with minimum going on. Yeah, I think that would just help her to, you know, to know, hey, we're. I'm getting out there and I'll do it and we'll get out there and get traveling. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Once I book it by Friday, I should have something because I. I do have 7, 8 properties to visit before the end of this year. So those two, then Branson woods and Lakes, they're right apart. You're at Branson Wood. You could drive to Branson Lakes. That's normally how I do it. It's about 25 minutes apart. 25, 30 minutes. And then from there, of course, the three in Tennessee. Right. Wild Beer, River Terrace, and so that's seven. And then New York. I mean, you probably. I don't know if you. You're probably not going to do a lot in New York, but for me, I still kind of not really oversee the front office, but because they use FDC and all that, you know, so I still have some time with them in New York, so I want to go up there. But. But. Yeah, but. But definitely Williamsburg and Myrtle beach and then Branson was. I want to kind of knock those out or maybe I'll do Tennessee before. Just depend. Depends on what comes up. Because I'm about to roll out the water park feature in Tennessee on the 9th. And if they're having issues, I may just go up there after I get back from. From Williamsburg. Right. And. And Myrtle beach, if they're having issue, if I need to go up there. So it just depends. But right now I. I. Can always squeeze in November 70 going out to, you know, the rest of them. Yeah. Goal is I'd like to see everybody before that in a year. But. Yeah, I don't know how that's going to work out, but we'll see. We'll see how. But at least if I can go see a good chunk of them. Yeah. And, you know, hey, if that's. If that's the course you want to take, then let's take it and we'll go. We'll go out there. Yeah, I mean, I definitely want to knock out Those six before or what is it? Seven before, before like mid November. So it would be Myrtle Beach, Williamsburg, Branson, woods and Lakes and then all of Tennessee. Okay, so there's two, two and three, woods and Lakes, Myrtle beach and Williamsburg and then the three in Tennessee. So that's seven. So definitely before mid, mid November. Which you know that, that should, that sounds like a lot. But the good thing is with Branson woods and Lakes they're right, they're close to each other and then Tennessee, they're right there like 10, 12 minutes apart. Okay, so you visit one, you visit all. You usually go Tuesday and Friday usually go. It just depends this time. I may go, I may go during the week. It just depends. Like when I was doing the rollout, if I'm going for a specific reason to assess the front office, I want to go when it's busy. So I want to go weekend. I want to see them doing check ins. I wanna. So it just depends. But this is just a regular visit for me. I mean actually in Williamsburg they're you know, the front office manager there, she's had some concerns with housekeeping and that they're not getting the room on time. And you know one of the things that I'm working on for her also is a better report that she could look at to see how many rooms are actually. I mean they have FTC that they're looking at right now but I'm going to work on something for them to show like pre reg rooms waited and, and guests waiting for room and a few other things. So I have a report that I'm working on for her that I think is going to help and I also want to introduce it to housekeeping too. Just so they're all looking at the same numbers because the fd the team up there doesn't use fdc. I'm not sure what and I know they use Rex but it would, it would just be good for them to kind of know what's happening at the front office too in terms of how many guests are waiting for a room. Right. Pre reg guests coming in and, and just, just everything that the Frontex is looking at and I feel like there's some, there's a big communication gap up there because I, I remember the like a year ago when I went up there, their arrivals was a piece of paper. Even though they have the system it was a paper paper that they write on like the rooms checking out what's coming in or I don't know what the hell they were writing and then they would come in from housekeeping and they left it like in this little area and they pick it up and then they, they. Then they leave. And I remember accent, very old school. I mean, it's effective, but very old school. Just, you know, there's so many. There's so many better ways to, to. To make that process better and to speed up that process. And they were doing that for a while. I'm like, man, until, you know, we kind of get them more into the system. But I kind of want to give them a little bit more tools now to have an overall view. And what we'll do is before we, you know, if you get to travel with me, then go over the report with you so you could kind of see what it is and let me know if that will work for them too. I mean, I have it working at the Village, the Lakes right now in Smokey Park City and a few other properties that is using that report right now. So I'm going to customize it for them. And it's just, it's. It's literally just a dashboard that kind of shows reservations coming in, if there's any pre reg. If there's any, any rooms, guests waiting to check into a room, VIP code blues coming in and a few other things. So really there's really detailed report and you could just click on refresh and give you an overall of what's going on for the day to keep you updated. Properties, Those properties. Housekeeping knows about that reporting? I don't, I don't think so. Because I was asking the front office leader and they're like, do. What report do you use right now? He's like, we don't, we don't really use report. We don't have a report. I'm like, okay, so, like, how do you communicate? Well, we just created a teams group, so when we have our guests waiting for rooms, we just send it in that teams chat. I'm like, okay, all right. I mean something. But, you know, yeah. So yeah, there's, there's definitely, definitely some opportunities there for improvement. So that's going to be my goal for going up there is to really provide them with tools and see if we could standardize some process between. For office and housekeeping. Yeah. And going together shows them our support together as a team. Absolutely. You know, absolutely. And it shows that we're in this together when we're here to help each other. So. Yeah, yeah, I got no problem at all doing that and supporting and helping out with that stuff. So. Yeah, no, definitely, yeah. So that. That should be good. I know with. With Myrtle beach, their biggest thing was overbooking has nothing to do with housekeeping or front office, but it was just overbooking for them, which we spoke to inventory, and we. We kind of got that fixed. They were just being way too aggressive. Very, very aggressive with the overbooking. I mean, they were overbooking by 20, 30% to the point where they were walking reservations outside or to the hotel side, from timeshare owners to the hotel side. We end up giving back weeks. Like, we're giving back, like, five ownership weeks every week. So, yeah, that. That one was tough, but that was. That was fixed. Again, that was an inventory thing. Right. Had nothing to do with. With the front officer housekeeping. But. You know, and I can tell you, as. As I've been going out, out to properties, there's a lot of inconsistency, you know, and inefficiencies that. That, yeah, they're running their operation. They're running their operation. They're getting things done. But we can be more efficient in what we're doing out there. Yeah. Myrtle beach and, you know, anywhere that we come in and it's like, okay, we've been doing this, this way for so long, and you've gotten, you know, stuck in your way. We just need to change that habit, you know, and be more efficient in what we're doing. Yeah, and I've noticed that across. Across. You know, if it's happening here in Florida, I'm sure it's happening everywhere else as well. Yeah, no, it is. It definitely is. Yeah. Yeah, definitely is. So. So, yeah, so sounds good. But, yeah, once you figure out the dates, let me know. You know, like I said, let's. Let's book it and we'll go together. And, you know, I'm sure if I tell Lisa, hey, she'll be fine as well. No, I'm sure. I'm sure. Getting out there and. Yeah, I'm sure she's getting out there and getting it, you know. Yeah, getting things in place and getting things. You know, my big project right now is in the laundry. And, you know, we're trying to build the business in there and get that business to grow and pick up other hotels out there, but I can't do that until I get some equipment, you know, that we need. So I've been at the trade show all weekend. I'll back out there this morning to kind of work with some vendors and say, hey, you know, work on some pricing and stuff for me. So I've got Someone giving me some quotes. They're from my laundry tomorrow. But we want to increase that and get some, some local properties as well to pick up their laundry. And if I got a low ball, then, you know, Mitch is like, go as low as you want. Just get the business, you know, and it gets our name out there and, you know, it becomes a new entity for our company as, you know, not. Yeah, we got laundry facilities and we're doing laundry across country. Yeah. And stuff. So that's, that's been my big project coming in. And it's, you know, we're getting things working, we're getting things in place and you know, Eva does great out there. It's just a matter of, you know, I gotta break her habits. Yeah. Yeah, you'll definitely find a lot of that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's, you know, here. Fine. I, I've been, I've been dealing with that a lot in these different properties and stuff and just coming through and breaking those habits. So. Yeah. Were you, Are you, are you in the back? Are you up by the cafeteria there? Yeah, I'm up here in the housekeeping office, actually. Willie's office. Oh, cool. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Where do you. I came through and you know, and, and it's good for me to build those relationships as well. With your teams. Yeah. You know, and know who your, your teams are and know. Hey, you know, if I see you, I'm here, You know, we're here together. We're here, you know, and, and things like that too. So I want to make sure we're facing. And especially now that we're, you know, we're slow season, we can make these changes. Let's make them. It's a lot easier now, you know, instead of doing in the most busy season. So. Yeah. And at some point I want to get with you and Michelle and, and the other nationals to go over the summit. There is a, there's a, there's a section on the summit. I, I believe it's the last day where we're, we're gonna do like panel discussion and it's just, you know, to, if you want to assign someone or you yourself, like you have people like Pat or Michelle or that is very vocal. Right. And they know a lot about like Westgate. So if you want to do it yourself or assign someone. But the questions that we're gonna ask is, it's gonna be like pre filtered questions already. So like I sent a, A survey to the team to see what question they would want to ask housekeeping you'll know those questions before and then it's like a 15, 30 minute panel where you know, it's probably, it's probably going to be like three different tables. So you'll have all the national directors and I think I have someone from inventory and another department and they'll just come up and ask the questions and, and so on. But it's, it's already questions that you already know. They may ask something else that is not there. But. Yeah, but it's a way for them to get to know who is who also. Right. And put a face to a name and get to know the housekeeping and all the other departments or partners, all the, all the players. I was at Blue Truth this morning and Benjamin was asking me, so when you doing your se. When you doing your. Oh my God, relax. Listen, this is, this is the first. So we've never had a summit before. None of the big three department have ever had a summit in 25 years. But never. And, and when you think about it for an office and housekeeping are the two biggest department in, in any, in any resort. But you have like a wow team. Even activities, they, they have summit before but a front office. Housekeeping has never had a summit before. So this is the first one. When I got this position two years ago, I've been asking like, can we do a summit? Because the wow team, they had just started, they're only like three years old and they've been having summit every single year. This is their third summit, which is, I think it's in two weeks. This is their third summit and they're three years in. So every year they've had a summit, you know, so yeah, this one I've been fighting to have a summit for the last, yeah, three years. So finally it happened. I mean the, the budget wasn't what I wanted, but you know, I'll work with it. Where are you doing it at? At the Villas. Okay. Yeah. So at the Villas. So they're right now, they're set up to fly in on Sunday the 19th that we have the 20th, 21st, 22nd and flying out on the 22nd or the morning of the 23rd. Okay. Yeah. Okay. It is a jump pack summit, you know, some really, some really good stuff, especially as it relates to training development, you know, and, and, and just overall team member talent and talent recognition and a whole bunch of financial. There's a whole bunch of classes that we're going to be doing and teaching. Yeah. And then there's some fun stuff also. I want to take them to the ranch and do some fun stuff. So. Yeah, yeah, I know we did. We did some consumer credit Disney. And it was, you know, we got in the financials. We got as granular as, you know, you know, the cost of a pen. Oh yeah.0002 cents. Oh yeah. And there's, you know, 2000 of you across property. And we're doing this 365 days a year. This is how much money we're wasting with you guys, you know, and it was. We would make a joke about it. All the time, but it was, you. Know, they all start cleaning their pockets out, you know, but it. It made sense to people. And I've always told people, you know, that's. That's understanding the why of why you're doing what you're doing. You know, you just don't clean the room. Just clean room. You do a clean room. Yeah. You know, sell it and you're. You're a salesperson. Stacy's going to be the one teaching the financial class. And you know, she's really good at that. She's really good at numbers and financial. So she's gonna really break it down in layman terms. So yeah, it's gonna be some of this stuff. And most of them, all of them already know financials, you know, income statement, P L and all that stuff. But she's gonna put a different approach to it to make them understand a little bit more. So, yeah, it's gonna be fun. Some. Some really cool stuff that we're doing for them. We're gonna roll out also all the stuff that we're working on that in the lms, which is our new like, learning management system. So there's a few things that we're working on for front office that they can now do there. They can see like the checklist that we rolled out. But there's career path and that we're looking at where someone could say, hey, I want to grow, but how do I get there? So there's quite a few things that we're looking at for there too. So it's going to be really. Add me and I'll be there. Yeah. So for you guys, I mean. I mean, you're more than welcome to attend any day. I think it's already on your calendar. I'm not sure if I think it is. But. But your day, whether it's you or you want to assign someone from your team would be on the 22nd, that last day. Yeah. And that's October, right? October. Yeah. Yeah. I haven't seen Anything on my calendar? No. So may. Okay, so maybe it's just gonna come out for just your invite, like, for that day, but I'll make sure you're added all the days, and if you. If you want to show up, feel free. If not, then on the 22nd. That will be the day. Okay. Yeah, perfect. We'll be there. I'll be there. So definitely. All right, so what. What I'll do is I'll. Hopefully by Friday. I should have it by Friday. The dates for. For when I'm flying out, and then I'll let you know. And then before we flow out, I want to go over the report with you, put a plan together, and then once we get up there, we kind of just hit the ground running with the plan. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back in office tomorrow in the morning. I've got some calls in the morning, and we got the GM call, and then I'll be in there on and off Thursday office, too, so. Okay, so if you're. If you're around, we can sit down and. And go through it as well and stuff, so. All right, sounds good. So maybe. Maybe on Thursday. Maybe on Thursday we could go through the report and. Yeah, yeah, sounds good. Sounds good, man. All right. Appreciate it, man. Thank you. And, Omar, that was your number. You called me? Yes. Yeah, that's my. That's my personal. Okay, perfect. I'll save that. Make sure I got it. Sounds good. Thanks, Omar. We'll talk soon, buddy. Okay, thank you.","📅 **Meeting Overview**: The purpose of the meeting was to discuss operational strategies and upcoming travel plans for site visits, addressing ongoing issues in housekeeping and front office departments, and planning for upcoming events and summits.

And I, you know, to me, it doesn't matter where I start. Okay. I prefer Tennessee over anywhere else, but I, I don't, you know, I don't have to start Tennessee as long as I make it there at some point. Yeah, I know she's got a lot of linen issues. She's got issues with Smokey and the bins. And. Yeah, they're using more of our bins for storage than, Than anything else. And I know, you know, I know they're building that new office building out there and they're going to take over that. Yeah, we don't know all the full details and stuff on it, but, you know, I, to me, it's. I gotta get out to the other properties anyways and see them. So. Yeah, yeah, I mean, I, I normally try to go to the ones first that are having, you know, like, issues. Right. You might want to. I normally try to target those ones first. Small. I mean, small, not smoky. Yeah, Smokey, I was there maybe five months ago. Okay. So that's why I'm kind of leaving them for last. But. Yeah, well, I know. And, and I know Lisa was talking to me. She wants to go out and go with me just to introduce me, you know, to the teams and stuff out there. But, you know, like, like, like I told her as well, I don't mind going out with, you know, like I did. I did the QA with field. Yeah. Range. Yeah. You know, so it was the first time I'd done a QA with him. I don't mind going to other properties with, you know, you or. Yeah, Evie, you know, as long as I get introduced to the team and. Yeah, okay, hey, great. You go do your thing, I'll do mine. And yeah, you know, hey, they know we're together. They know we're, you know, we're out here and stuff. I, I got no problem going that way too. So. To be honest with you, the, the last national director, that was housekeeping. National director. Me and him used to travel together because. Okay. Yeah. So whenever we go somewhere, it would be me and him because it kind of makes sense, right? Because one of the. When it comes to housekeeping and front office, like, those two departments are probably the two departments that works closest together. So whenever we, we would go out, both of us will find out what issues they're having. And normally, you know how it is. Normally it's. It's front desk, it's housekeeping, it's front deck. So both of us will take that on and be like, okay, let's talk. Let's see how we could fix this. And then, you know, I normally come up with, like, maybe they're missing some tools that I can give them, whether it's a report or whatever. And they're like, hey, this is, you know, so it normally works like we did the same thing. A few properties. We went and. And we always find where the pointing finger happens. And then we come in and we're like, yeah, let's. Let's fix this. Let's talk. So. And. And a lot of too, you know, your. Your medallion scores affect mine. Mine affect yours. Yeah, you know, indirectly, but directly. Yeah. You know. Yeah. And, you know, and like I told Ken yesterday, you know, I told Ken, I said, put me on all your RPM calls. If I make it, I make it. If I don't, at least, you know, we're. I'm on there with you, and if I need to support you on anything, if anything's going on, you know, what a specific one, the next one we tagged me on and say, I definitely need you on here. So they make sure we have that support. And I said, no problem. Right. So he added me on to all of his. So I'm on there, you know, with. With those as well. And, you know, like you said, I got no problem. You know, hey, if. If we travel together. Great. We travel together. Yeah. We go together. And that's something. We can talk. Lisa, you know, Peter, whoever about. And say, hey, yeah, it makes sense, you know, to me. Yeah. You know, it's. It's that great partnership. Yeah. That we need to have, you know. Yeah. So are you. Do you have any like. Like anything front office, housekeeping related now, concerns that anyone brought up? I know it's kind of early right now. You're still kind of getting to know the players, but. Yeah, no, it's. It's. You know, I spent some time with Orlando learning the system. So I was in learning system and kind of going from there, but it's, you know, just. It's nothing that stood out really bad that I said, man, I gotta go see Omar, you know, you know, and. And talk to them that way and stuff. And, you know, like you said, still out there seeing the players and, you know, meeting them, you know, and. And making sure, you know, we're all communicating. Right. Right. Once you start getting out there, I mean, there. There may be quite a few things that may come across your plate as it relates to front office. Right. There may be. You may have some team members saying that, hey, I don't have access to fdc. Right. That's probably one that you may hear now. FDC is the new front office PMS system that we're using at the front desk. And a few months ago, we rolled out phase two to all the properties. Some properties were on phase one. Most properties were still on the old system called Mr. So you'll hear those terms Mr. And FDC. If someone asks you about getting access, there's quite a few things that you need to know and how to respond. So if they had Mr. In the past and they were using it and they still kind of. Because Mr. Is still there, we still have to use Mr. To do certain things like booking, reservation and so on. Right. Because we're still working on that. But if they, if they had Mr. Access in the past and it still, still active, then it's. We can. I. You can send me their name or they can email me and I could get them access to FDC. However, if they've never had a system access or Mr. Mr. Access in the past, then they need to submit a system access before they can get FDC access. All right? So that may come up. When you visit some of these properties, especially some of the supervisors and so on, they're like, hey, I don't have access and how do I get access? But that's, that's the process and how to get access. And everyone should know how to go into like the service request and submit access to get system access. So that's how they get the Mr. SAMs access. They need that first, that system access before they could get granted into the Mr. Access. So that, that, that may come up once you go with them, but other than that, I mean, I, I don't. I can't think of anything else that, you know, there's always going to be stuff coming up, but this is probably the one that has been coming just because we, we rolled it out a few months ago and some of them still don't have access. Even though you give them the instructions like, hey, you need to get this done. They're still saying that I don't have access. But you've got to follow the process, right? You got to get the system access before we could grant you access to the system. And that's just kind of how it works. Yeah. Where you, where are you traveling to next? I haven't decided. I'm going to take this week and figure it out. But it's between Brunswoods. No, I think I'm gonna do out far out first. Because I, I just finished the Vegas side up west, like Park City, Vegas and Pitten Mountain. So I think I'm, I think I may do Williamsburg and Myrtle beach because they're close by. Okay. Yeah. So I'll probably fly into either Williamsburg or Myrtle beach and then fly from there to the other one, then fly back home because they're, they're like an hour apart rather than flying back home and then going back again. Okay, yeah, well, let me know. Let's, let's talk to Lisa. And like I said, I don't mind as long as I'm going with someone. I'm just not going into a property, you know. Yeah, I don't mind going in and, you know, and if we travel together. We travel together. Yeah. I mean, if she wants to travel with you to do the introduction and then after that, then that's fine. But. Yeah, but I mean, normally you just let Valerie, you, normally you pick the date when you're going. And I get it. You're, you're new. So she may want to do the introduction, but normally you just pick the date, let Valeria know, she'll book it. Honestly, I, I, I do. I don't do the booking, but I, I look up the ticket myself, the dates, everything, and I'll just tell Valeria, hey, this is the flight. This is what it is. And then she book it. Right. But I look up everything in the back end and just send it to him like, hey, this is the day I'm going. This is the time. This is the flight and all that. And then she'll, she'll do the booking. But, yeah, and I might just tell her that's, you know, that's what I would do because I know Peter keeps pushing, pushing, pushing. You got to get out there. You got to get out there. You got to get up. Yeah. You know, and, and I, you know, and I definitely want to get out there, too, and start meeting them. And. Yeah, yeah, I got, I got my national call on Friday, but I want to make sure I'm out of business properties. I got, I got Williamsburg right now looking for shampoo machine that's, you know, $2500. And I told him, hold on a second, guys, listen. Oh, wow. Yeah, yeah. So I can find something cheaper, but it's, you know, why are you doing this? What's going, you know, and I want to make sure I'm there to support them and not just say, no, we're not going to buy this. We're going to find something else for them, you know, What? I mean. Yeah, yeah. And, you know, help them. Help them understand that. So. Yeah, I guess, you know, once. Once you find something and, you know, you find dates where you're going, just let me know. And I. I'll go with Bolero and we'll. We'll book together and go together. Yeah, yeah. And stuff. And I think. I think that'll help Lisa out, too, because she is. She's bombarded with minimum going on. Yeah, I think that would just help her to, you know, to know, hey, we're. I'm getting out there and I'll do it and we'll get out there and get traveling. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Once I book it by Friday, I should have something because I. I do. Have. 7, 8 properties to visit before the end of this year. So those two, then Branson woods and Lakes, they're right apart. You're at Branson Wood. You could drive to Branson Lakes. That's normally how I do it. It's about 25 minutes apart. 25, 30 minutes. And then from there, of course, the three in Tennessee. Right. Wild Beer, River Terrace, and so that's seven. And then New York. I mean, you probably. I don't know if you. You're probably not going to do a lot in New York, but for me, I still kind of not really oversee the front office, but because they use FDC and all that, you know, so I still have some time with them in New York, so I want to go up there. But. But. Yeah, but. But definitely Williamsburg and Myrtle beach and then Branson was. I want to kind of knock those out or maybe I'll do Tennessee before. Just depend. Depends on what comes up. Because I'm about to roll out the water park feature in Tennessee on the 9th. And if they're having issues, I may just go up there after I get back from. From Williamsburg. Right. And. And Myrtle beach, if they're having issue, if I need to go up there. So it just depends. But right now I. I. Can always squeeze in November 70 going out to, you know, the rest of them. Yeah. Goal is I'd like to see everybody before that in a year. But. Yeah, I don't know how that's going to work out, but we'll see. We'll see how. But at least if I can go see a good chunk of them. Yeah. And, you know, hey, if that's. If that's the course you want to take, then let's take it and we'll go. We'll go out there. Yeah, I mean, I definitely want to knock out those six before or what is it? Seven before, before like mid November. So it would be Myrtle Beach, Williamsburg, Branson, woods and Lakes and then all of Tennessee. Okay, so there's two, two and three, woods and Lakes, Myrtle beach and Williamsburg and then the three in Tennessee. So that's seven. So definitely before mid, mid November which you know that, that should, that sounds like a lot. But the good thing is with Branson woods and Lakes they're right, they're close to each other and then Tennessee, they're right there like 10, 12 minutes apart. Okay, so you visit one, you visit all. You usually go Tuesday and Friday usually go. It just depends this time I may go, I may go during the week. It just depends. Like when I was doing the rollout, if I'm going for a specific reason to assess the front office, I want to go when it's busy so I want to go weekend. I want to see them doing check ins. I wanna. So it just depends. But this is just a regular visit for me. I mean actually in Williamsburg they're you know, the front office manager there, she's had some concerns with housekeeping and that they're not getting the room on time. And you know one of the things that I'm working on for her also is a better report that she could look at to see how many rooms are actually. I mean they have FTC that they're looking at right now but I'm going to work on something for them to show like pre reg rooms waited and, and guests waiting for room and a few other things. So I have a report that I'm working on for her that I think is going to help and I also want to introduce it to housekeeping too. Just so they're all looking at the same numbers because the fd the team up there doesn't use fdc. I'm not sure what and I know they use Rex but it would, it would just be good for them to kind of know what's happening at the front office too in terms of how many guests are waiting for a room. Right. Pre reg guests coming in and, and just, just everything that the Frontex is looking at. And I feel like there's some, there's a big communication gap up there because I, I remember the like a year ago when I went up there, their arrivals was a piece of paper. Even though they have the system, it was a paper paper that they write on like the rooms checking out what's coming in or I don't know what the hell they were writing. And then they would come in from housekeeping and they left it like in this little area and they pick it up and then they, they. Then they leave. And I remember accent, very old school. I mean, it's effective, but very old school. Just, you know, there's so many, there's so many better ways to, to, to make that process better and to speed up that process. And they were doing that for a while. I'm like, man, until, you know, we kind of get them more into the system. But I kind of want to give them a little bit more tools now to have an overall view. And what we'll do is before we, you know, if you get to travel with me, then go over the report with you so you could kind of see what it is and let me know if that will work for them too. I mean, I have it working at the Village, the Lakes right now in Smokey Park City and a few other properties that is using that report right now. So I'm going to customize it for them. And it's just, it's. It's literally just a dashboard that kind of shows reservations coming in, if there's any pre reg. If there's any, any rooms, guests waiting to check into a room, VIP code blues coming in and a few other things. So really, there's really detailed report and you could just click on refresh and give you an overall of what's going on for the day to keep you updated. Properties, those properties. Housekeeping knows about that reporting? I don't, I don't think so because I was asking the front office leader and they're like, do. What report do you use right now? He's like, we don't, we don't really use report. We don't have a report. I'm like, okay, so, like, how do you communicate? Well, we just created a teams group, so when we have our guests waiting for rooms, we just send it in that teams chat. I'm like, okay, all right. I mean, something. But, you know, yeah. So yeah, there's, there's definitely, definitely some opportunities there for improvement. So that's going to be my goal for going up there is to really provide them with tools and see if we could standardize some process between. For office and housekeeping. Yeah. And going together shows them our support together as a team. Absolutely. You know, absolutely. And it shows that we're in this together when we're here to help each other. So, yeah, yeah, I got no problem at all doing that and supporting and helping out with that stuff. So, yeah, no Definitely, yeah. So that. That should be good. I know with. With Myrtle beach, their biggest thing was overbooking has nothing to do with housekeeping or front office, but it was just overbooking for them, which we spoke to inventory, and we. We kind of got that fixed. They were just being way too aggressive. Very, very aggressive with the overbooking. I mean, they were overbooking by 20, 30% to the point where they were walking reservations outside or to the hotel side, from timeshare owners to the hotel side. We end up giving back weeks. Like, we're giving back, like, five ownership weeks every week. So, yeah, that. That one was tough, but that was. That was fixed. Again, that was an inventory thing. Right. Had nothing to do with. With the front officer housekeeping. But. You know, and I can tell you, as. As I've been going out, out to properties, there's a lot of inconsistency, you know, and inefficiencies that. That, yeah, they're running their operation. They're running their operation. They're getting things done. But we can be more efficient in what we're doing out there. Yeah. Myrtle beach and, you know, anywhere that we come in and it's like, okay, we've been doing this this way for so long, and you've gotten, you know, stuck in your way. We just need to change that habit, you know, and be more efficient in what we're doing. Yeah, and I've noticed that across. Across. You know, if it's happening here in Florida, I'm sure it's happening everywhere else as well. Yeah, no, it is. It definitely is. Yeah. Yeah, definitely is. So. So, yeah, so sounds good. But, yeah, once you figure out the dates, let me know. You know, like I said, let's. Let's book it and we'll go together. And, you know, I'm sure if I tell Lisa. Hey, she'll be fine as well. No, I'm sure. I'm sure. Getting out there and. Yeah, I'm sure she's getting out there and getting it, you know. Yeah, getting things in place and getting things. You know, my big project right now is in the laundry. And, you know, we're trying to build the business in there and get that business to grow and pick up other hotels out there, but I can't do that until I get some equipment, you know, that we need. So I've been at the trade show all weekend. I'll back out there this morning to kind of work with some vendors and say, hey, you know, work on some pricing and stuff for me. So I'VE got someone giving me some quotes. They're from my laundry tomorrow. But we want to increase that and get some, some local properties as well to pick up their laundry. And if I got a low ball, then, you know, Mitch is like, go as low as you want. Just get the business, you know, and it gets our name out there and, you know, it becomes a new entity for our company as, you know, not. Yeah, we got laundry facilities and we're doing laundry across country. Yeah. And stuff. So that's, that's been my big project coming in. And it's, you know, we're getting things working, we're getting things in place and you know, Eva does great out there. It's just a matter of, you know, I gotta break her habits. Yeah. Yeah, you'll definitely find a lot of that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's, you know, here, fine. I, I've been, I've been dealing with that a lot in these different properties and stuff and just coming through and breaking those habits. So. Yeah. Were you, Are you, are you in the back? Are you up by the cafeteria there? Yeah, I'm up here in the housekeeping office, actually. Willie's office. Oh, cool. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Where do you. I came through and you know, and, and it's good for me to build those relationships as well. With your teams. Yeah. You know, and know who your, your teams are and know, hey, you know, if I see you, I'm here, You know, we're here together. We're here, you know, and, and things like that too. So I want to make sure we're facing. And especially now that we're, you know, we're slow season, we can make these changes. Let's make them. It's a lot easier now, you know, instead of doing in the most busy season. So. Yeah. And at some point I want to get with you and Michelle and, and the other nationals to go over the summit. There is a, there's a, there's a section on the summit. I, I believe it's the last day where we're, we're gonna do like panel discussion and it's just, you know, to, if you want to assign someone or you yourself, like you have people like Pat or Michelle or that is very vocal. Right. And they know a lot about like Westgate. So if you want to do it yourself or assign someone. But the questions that we're gonna ask is, it's gonna be like pre filtered questions already. So like I sent a, a survey to the team to see what question they would want to Ask Housekeeping. You'll know those questions before and then it's like a 15, 30 minute panel where you know, it's probably, it's probably going to be like three different tables. So you'll have all the national directors and I think I have someone from inventory and another department and they'll just come up and ask the questions and, and so on. But it's, it's already questions that you already know. They may ask something else that is not there. But. Yeah, but it's a way for them to get to know who is who also. Right. And put a face to a name and get to know the housekeeping and all the other departments or partners, all the, all the players. I was at Blue Truth this morning and Benjamin was asking me, so when you doing your se. When you doing your. Oh my God. Relax. Listen, this is, this is the first. So we've never had a summit before. None of the big three department have ever had a summit in 25 years. But never. And, and when you think about it for an office and housekeeping are the two biggest department in, in any, in any resort. But you have like a wow team. Even activities, they, they have summit before but a front office. Housekeeping has never had a summit before. So this is the first one. When I got this position two years ago, I've been asking like, can we do a summit? Because the wow team, they had just started, they're only like three years old and they've been having summit every single year. This is their third summit, which is, I think it's in two weeks. This is their third summit and they're three years in. So every year they've had a summit, you know, so yeah, this one I've been fighting to have a summit for the last, yeah, three years. So finally it happened. I mean the, the budget wasn't what I wanted but you know, I'll work with it. Where are you doing it at? At the Villas. Okay. Yeah. So at the Villas. So they're right now, they're set up to fly in on Sunday the 19th that we have the 20th, 21st, 22nd and flying out on the 22nd or the morning of the 23rd. Okay. Yeah. Okay. It is a jump pack summit, you know, some really, some really good stuff, especially as it relates to training development, you know, and, and, and just overall team member talent and talent recognition and a whole bunch of financial. There's a whole bunch of classes that we're going to be doing and teaching. Yeah. And then there's some fun stuff also. I Want to take them to the ranch and do some fun stuff. So. Yeah. Yeah, I know we did. We did some consumer credit Disney. And it was, you know, we got in the financials. We got as granular as, you know, you know, the cost of a pen. Oh yeah.0002 cents. Oh yeah. And there's, you know, 2000 of you across property. And we're doing this 365 days a year. This is how much money we're wasting with you guys, you know. And it was. We would make a joke about it. All the time, but it was, you. Know, they all start cleaning their pockets out. You know, but it. It made sense to people. And I've always told people, you know, that's. That's understanding the why of why you're doing what you're doing. You know, you just don't clean the room. Just clean room. You do a clean room. Yeah. You know, sell it and you're. You're a salesperson. Stacy's going to be the one teaching the financial class. And you know, she's really good at that. She's really good at numbers and financial. So she's gonna really break it down in layman terms. So yeah, it's gonna be some of this stuff. And most of them, all of them already know financials, you know, income statement, P L and all that stuff. But she's gonna put a different approach to it to make them understand a little bit more. So, yeah, it's gonna be fun. Some. Some really cool stuff that we're doing for them. We're gonna roll out also all the stuff that we're working on that in the lms, which is our new like, learning management system. So there's a few things that we're working on for front office that they can now do there. They can see like the checklist that we rolled out. But there's career path and that we're looking at where someone could say, hey, I want to grow, but how do I get there? So there's quite a few things that we're looking at for there too. So it's going to be really. Add me and I'll be there. Yeah. So for you guys, I mean. I mean, you're more than welcome to attend any day. I think it's already on your calendar. I'm not sure if I think it is. But. But your day, whether it's you or you want to assign someone from your team would be on the 22nd, that last day. Yeah. And that's October, right? October. Yeah. Yeah. I haven't seen anything on my calendar. No. So may. Okay, so maybe it's just gonna come out for just your invite, like, for that day, but I'll make sure you're added all the days, and if you. If you want to show up, feel free. If not, then on the 22nd, that will be the day. Okay. Yeah, perfect. We'll be there. I'll be there. So definitely. All right, so what. What I'll do is I'll. Hopefully by Friday. I should have it by Friday. The dates for. For when I'm flying out, and then I'll let you know. And then before we flow out, I want to go over the report with you, put a plan together, and then once we get up there, we kind of just hit the ground running with the plan. I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back in office tomorrow in the morning. I've got some calls in the morning, and we got the GM call, and then I'll be in there on and off Thursday office, too, so. Okay, so if you're. If you're around, we can sit down and. And go through it as well and stuff, so. All right, sounds good. So maybe. Maybe on Thursday. Maybe on Thursday we could go through the report and. Yeah, yeah, sounds good. Sounds good, man. All right. Appreciate it, man. Thank you. And, Omar, that was your number. You called me? Yes. Yeah, that's my. That's my personal. Okay, perfect. I'll save that. Make sure I got it. Sounds good. Thanks, Omar. We'll talk soon, buddy. Okay, thank you.","📅 **Meeting Overview**: The meeting discussed site visits, addressing operational inefficiencies, recent system updates, and upcoming travel plans.

Does that make sense? Like so in talent acquisition, you're not supposed to do that. Every wreck should be a new wreck so that you have historical data on those, but it's not. Golf cart attendant is one wreck and everyone is hired into that one wreck. I see, I see. So it's always the wreck always gonna be. Yeah, right. You see what I'm saying? Yeah. But it shouldn't be like that. You should be able to see that. I had five golf cart attendant wrecks and this is the history of all of those wrecks. That's really how it should work. And Trisha's been trying to get that changed for a while, but I don't think our systems would allow us to do that or something. And so that's what's happening is that when they're asking them to open that position, if it's somebody, it's up here, it's up here. Vi says all of their information is up here. They don't write anything down. Oh. But that really speaks to some of the things that Westgate. That's the problem in TA is that because they turn over those team, those recruiters so often, somebody just wouldn't know and they would just back for the wreck. That's what's happening. So Trish is going to have to figure out a way to get that. Like. Yeah, I don't know what she's going to be able to do there, but. Okay. Okay. So. So we're good with those three checklists I'm sending them. I was just going through them in the, in the LMS to make sure that they were built properly. And so we're good with those three titles. So Guest Relations, Guest Experience and Resort Services Operator. Hold on, what was the second one? Guess. Guest gem. Oh, Jim. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes. Okay. Golf cart and Bell Staff. We're gonna leave it how it is for now. As in. As in we're not turning them on. We'Re not putting them, we're not separating them. Okay. Oh, we're not separating. Right. We're gonna leave it how it is. Bell services for now. There's. There's equally the same pros and cons with separating them and keeping them together. Spoke to pretty much everyone again from the gyms that would be affected, the department leaders that would be affected, hr. And. I mean the pros and cons, we're looking at more of a elevated department. Right. And if we bring in team members that are more guest facing, then it will elevate the department a little bit more. However, the plan, if we keep it. So we're just going to keep it would be. And that's one of the conversation I had with HR this morning. How does. How do we promote this position? Right. Because it's a. It's like a multi job position. How do we promote it? And then when we hire someone for the field and that would be up to me. How do we. How do we decide who goes where? Right. So what we've came up with was that when we hire someone, the position is going to be post as best services and then it's going to say like golf cart duties and then bell services, bell staff or something like that. Right. And the description will be for golf cart. So that's kind of what we discussed this morning. And so we still want to hire them to do that specific area, whether it's golf cart or bell staff. However, their training is going to be everything together right now. If they're in bell staff because that's what they're hired for and they. And we need help in golf cart, then they'll go to. Then they'll help. Right. So that's. That's kind of how we're approaching it. Okay. So is the thought that we want to then combine the two checklists into one. Yes. And figure out where there's overlap and do we want to do this now? So it's just sitting there ready, waiting to go or are we going to wait until we see the na actually hit and they. And then discuss how. How that impacts the checklist? Because this is the one where we can really use. Yes, this is the one we could. Really use any on this one. So did we. Did we tell you that it got moved from 2026 to scoops instead of. It's gonna be in Q4 of 2025. Things just told. Could be December, could be November. Yeah. Should we hold off? Because right now I rewrote it as if there was no N A. So I pulled out anything that was specific to golf cart because of the. The properties that don't have golf carts. Yeah, but how would the properties with golf cart operate? Because it's general enough that says. So that was that. Was that because they're very. The properties with golf cart. The golf cart trainings are very specific. So all I changed was I pulled out the two lines about golf cart training that were on day two. And it just says complete any additional CP training, practical exams and practice as required by your property. Okay. So that it just doesn't so it would. You'd have to keep with whatever record keeping you currently for the practical exam you wouldn't be able to use the lms. What about further down on that checklist where it goes over? There's two different other items. The Learn golf cart inspection, cleaning and maintenance. Learn out of service golf cart ticket. Those are all actually hot sauce items. When I spoke to Shane, he said that all those items except for like the, the cleaning and maintenance part, but the tickets, the sign out procedure, the check in procedure, all that are hot sauce items. So I was shoving them under there. Not completely. Okay, so the lakes for. For inspection and all those. Yes. For, for the lakes they use a different program to sign out. They have like a golf cart program that they use to sign out. But for the inspection and all that everyone use between the villas and the lakes they do use hot sauce. But for signing and signing out golf card, they use a different program at the lakes. Okay. And I think we had put like other. Our programs or something like that there. I don't remember. Any golf cart. I had shoved them all under hot sauce so that I can, I can pull them back out. And then. So then do we want to reinstate everything as it. As it was before and then just wait for the N.A. put any golf cart items that were on the golf cart attendant checklist that weren't already on bell services. I just, I feel like once we get the NA you may have to go back in. Right. That's why I'm like. And just kind of readjust. Four months. They didn't say. The problem is, is that they didn't say when in Q4. So I mean we're a month from Q4. Right. But. Right, Ari? Yeah. Yeah, pretty much. I mean who's Ryan Gaines? I have no idea. Westgate person. Yeah, he's. Email me me about Tablo Access. I don't. Table access. Rental revenue from Westgate. Grand Central from New York. Ryan Gaines. Oh, I know. Yes. At this rate, are we getting that Checklist out on 91? No. No. So at this rate, I don't mind. There's a possibility with the 10 one. I don't know if that's even on a work day, but the 101 release. We could ask Belinda on our next call. Like where is this at in Q4? I would just wait to be honest because you're. I don't want to, but that's just going to be double world. Okay, so let's go over it again. Once we know the NA Is. Yeah. Are just Created now with NA in mind. So once we get the na, you don't have to worry about, like, recreating anything and combining it. Hopefully. Hopefully. And combining it will kind of make it easier for you too. I mean, it's kind of one checklist. I like that, Dex. On the computer screen. I don't know who drew that. That's pretty cool. Okay, so I'll leave that. I'll just put a tickler thing in the file to revisit the checklists on 10.1 and find out where we are with the NA feature and how the jobs have all spun out. And can we all agree on. Yeah, that belongs to the checklist. Yeah. All right, so I think that's it about checklists. Okay. The only thing we were just. I was just mentioning to Adam is that it looks like all the job change profiles also include the Resort Ops Day 1 checklist. And they should not. Right. Say that again. The profiles that we use to assign courses for job change, because we have to assign them to new hires one way and job changes to the other. The job change ones include the Resort Ops Day 1 checklist. Now, if you're changing jobs, should you have done everything that's in that Resort Ops day one already and that you don't need that checklist again? So you're going from corporate to resort op. Okay, so then there's going to be overlap there, though, because in the corporate security and the one. The day one for corporate that Chris and I did, one that I started. And security, it's basically the same thing. If you have adp, stuff like that, like the majority of it's the same. Yeah. Like instead of meeting gm, it's like meeting your department leadership. Instead of property tour, it's like building. Tour, stuff like that. Throwing it out there because they would need those things. But. Nothing can ever. I mean, we could go back all of those. Well, it's a whole. It's a whole separate course that they have to do. So I feel like you would want to just remove it if you're not. If there's anything to sign it if you're transferring. Like, if I'm a resort, let's say I'm on Omar's team, but then I go to like housekeeping. Is there a way to. It's only going to understand that the. That tiling is going to not stuff that they're coming from. Yeah. So if you're going from resort to. Resort, it's a duplicate. I would just say leave it off. Okay. So that. That's a change that has to be then made to all the existing profiles. So do you want to change it? What do you mean? So if I go in already, I probably shouldn't have brought this up. Today feels like a Friday and it's only Tuesday so probably not. So if I look at job teams. So here's characters and if I go over here because this is such a stupid thing. Sorry. So I'm changing jobs. I do the welcome to Resort Ops and the animated character performance checklist. So do we still want them to do welcome to Resort Operations? It's built into every job change profile. So KP would have to go in and delete them all. Can you just turn them off? She can, she can delete. She'd have to delete out that class. She can't turn it. She would want us to leave it running. But she'd just have to delete that class. It's not a big deal to delete the one class but I just didn't want to. I just noticed it today when I was, when I was fixing the ones when I was sending her the information for Omar and I was like ah crap. Can we just ask, can we bringing this back up and bring it up with Alex. Okay. I just don't want to make decisions about reserve ops without him. Okay. Moving on. Quick hit things. The well loyalty screenshots. All good. Did you want. All good. Okay. So you're good. You're going to send them to Joanna? Already did. Spoke to her this morning. Who pays what is is still uncharged to go out. So I think you wanted to launch it the 28th. Yes. So the reason for that is I have my meeting on the 20th, my front office national meeting on the 29th. Okay. So I just want to show it to them real quick and show it to them there at the meeting. Okay. Yeah, we did. We did decide to trial a survey on the end of it. So there will be one extra thing. So it's going to be the elearning the chart and then just a five question survey and it's just a tiny experiment and then we'll figure out strategy going forward for how we would want to if we want to scale it. Okay. So that's that. Yeah. I realized I did not have a clue what you guys were talking about the other day. That's right. I did kind of grab you as you were walking down the hall. I was really mad at that point too. I did talk to Alex a bit. Got his perspective. His is a little different. We talked a little Bit about it. Okay, so we'll make sense. Scale it off every time. Water park at some ridiculous hour of the morning. I sent you to water park. I saw that. I'm look at the head but I'm. Like these are going out yesterday bled into today. But what do you call. So I don't know if you want to go over those or if there was other stuff that. That that's all that I had because needs to get out the door. So. So, so I can move on to the other stuff if you wanted to go over those or if you wanted. If there was other stuff that you had on your agenda. No, I think that was it. Did Julie respond and say that that's what the meeting is about? Oh, I was going to say that Friday at 2:00'. Clock. Yeah. What was she thinking? Wait, she said that meeting at 2 o'? Clock? Yes. I didn't see that I was Friday. Of a holiday weekend. What was, what was the reply from her though? Did she say I don't think any. Of them are on the email because. When I originally Elite. Hold on. Responded to her, took everybody off. Am I saying yes to this or not? Oh, she just said sounds good, I'll get something on the calendar. So she didn't really answer if it's the. I'm gonna go into a holiday weekend. Pissed off. If it's the release. But if it's the receipt. I'm sure it's a receipt release. And okay. Honestly I don't think you need to put anything together for that. Okay. Okay. Okay cool. It's. And if you do it's something really simple. Okay. Where to go, where to click print. Okay. I saw the one for. I figured out where the one was for for folios. So when I saw. It's just because kind of you hit the little three dots and yeah. You hit receipt. And I mean if it's. If it's. It's for the 50 hold or the hold whole. I'm assuming it would be somewhere under the whole section. Right. I mean that would probably be the best place to put it. So I don't, I don't see a lot of training needed for that. Okay. It seems like it's just an email and it's just gonna hound yeah you or me until something. So she has proof that they were. I'll just send out normally send out that email. They were informed. So that was the only other thing that I had. And then yeah it's just water park. So I did. Did front desk agent and I Did front desk managers first? The front desk managers would take the front desk agent course and the front end. The front desk manager course. The front desk manager will take the frontex agent course for. For water park. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. And then water park team members would just take their own, except for Smoky Mountain, who would have them take front desk agent and water park team members since they're going to be the ones issuing the. Yes. And I do think it's not necessary, but I do think the water park should take the water park, even though they're not going to be doing anything. Oh, the smoky water. The smoky water part. Because eventually. Okay, we may get them their own tablets and have them. Actually, they. I think they still need to take it as. Because if someone comes and say, hey, I didn't get, you know, fans or whatever, rather than coming back to the front decks, I would like for them to look it up right there rather than sending them back to the front decks. Okay. So you're going to equip them to be able to do that. Okay. I need to check in with River Ranch and the lakes. Well, I need to check in with Michelle to see if the water park. If the lakes and River Ranch have got their access yet and their devices. That's kind of her job. And if the. The link you send, if it's the Cook reference guide that you had and you just kind of put it there. I mean, I'm sure it's. I'm sure it's good to go. I jazzed it up a little bit. I gave it. I gave it a quiz at the end. Okay. So, yeah, I mean, it's all the same material, so it should be. It should be good. I'm trying to think if there was anything. Is it interactive or just. I started them out. It's not super interactive. I mean, there's some tabs and things that they can click on. There's a drag and drop. Okay. Some flip cards. I try to start out most of the lessons with a question and try and let them puzzle it out on their own first or take a guess at least, as opposed to just. Here's all the information. Right. So, you know, kind of that. More of that discovery type mindset as opposed to what you call. And it's set up just like, just. It's in the same 360. It's kind of same idea as Megan's that you can make comments on. On the screens. So. Okay, cool. Anything. I'm gonna go through it because I was a little delirious. Here. So I know there's a typo or two that I couldn't find and I'm like, I don't care, they're going out anyway. That's right. So I'll just, I'll just go give it one more pass through and make sure. There was nothing that I was a little iffy on the wording. Okay. For that. And I know we never. You still haven't heard about the idea of that it doesn't matter if they're staying on their, their, their usage. So I was intentionally vague to kind of leave that. Yeah, yeah, I, yeah, I wouldn't get into that too much. They're just going to follow their current procedure and the current procedure right now if a owner that books outside of their week outside of their account, if they can prove that they're an owner, we're still giving them the benefit. So if they book through Expedia Hotels.com we're still giving them all the benefits. If they can show, hey, I'm an owner with their phone or whatever, their, some of them still have their old card, we still give them the owner's benefit. Okay. Now just thinking of this, I know right now we're really focused on existing team members but going forward this will be something we can include in the whole new hire. We can add that whole onboarding thing the same way we're adding who pays. What is there going to be besides this? Are they going to get an introduction to water park policy in some other way or do we need to add any kind of policy information into this? We didn't add anything for the Frontex agent for water park. Right. This kind of came up after the checklist for water park. It says, it says it on. It just says the, like the day. It has like all the tabs. So I think the voucher tab is slash Water park is one of the checklist items. So it doesn't have any sub bullets. Or anything to explain it. No, but what you just said, Yes, I would love for it to be included, whatever, wherever it's going to be placed on the checklist. So when you get to it, that's going to be the lesson. Okay. Right. Yeah. And I think maybe that's the next step too is to start looking at some of these checklist items and turn them into elearning. Okay. Yeah, absolutely. So, but, so is there anything I need to. So when you're, when you're going through the course, are there any policies and procedures related to water park that I need to add to the Course that would, that would benefit a new hire. So just to keep that in mind. You have to think about that. Let me ask Michelle too. I can't think of any, you know, most of the stuff that I'm thinking of, it's really specific to the water park, like entrance capacity in terms of how many people. Those are just stuff that the water park team members need to know for front decks. Not really, but I'll, I'll, I'll talk to her, Michelle, and see if there's anything. But I really can't think of anything really. And then in terms of assignments, should this also get assigned to resort services operators? The water park? Yes, because they may get a call that says, hey, and they, you know, the guest doesn't know who they're talking to. They dial zero. They think they're talking to the front desk when it's resort services. So they're like, hey, I checked in and can you check how many water park pass I have left or something? So at least they'll know how to check it in reserve services. So yeah. Okay. And they can't add anything. The water park? Yeah, they can't. They wouldn't be able to add. You're not giving them any positions to add entries. Any permissions. Who did I give access from that? I think the managers does have access. I think. Think so. Okay, so we should add then the managers also to take the manager class and the front desk agent class. From resource services. Yes. Okay. Yeah, I think it's the manager. Did I add the supervisors? I think it's just the managers. And then what about guest relations? Do they need any access or do. They need any water? Oh, they do. They definitely do. And the same thing is it's split between guest relations agent and manager. Yes. Because so in guest relations, I just added the access. Recently, every single guest relations team member has access at the villas to override. Okay. Why? Because whenever sales have a new owner, they go to guest relations to get them access to the water park. So they should. So guest relations, agents and UP should take the. Both the, the agent and the. Yes. I said K's gonna love me when I try to explain how we're gonna. I mean you could just assign everything to all of front decks. Well, I don't want them to use if they're not. If they don't have the power to do something to do override, tell them to do it. I see what you're saying. Yeah. Because FriendX agent. Except Smoli. Otherwise the only one. Yeah. Have access to override do. Okay, so then hold on one second. Let me just. Both agent and manager. Okay. And then Smokey Smoke Weeds said their water park people should also take the word for team member. Their front desk agents, they still have the same split between managers have to do the override things. Right. Okay. Okay. So they get. They get assigned same thing. They just also get the water park. Yeah. One to be able to do the issuing point. Correct part. Because it, it should be like the permission should be divided by role. Like it should be based on role. So whichever property should still be manager. I think supervisors are not. If I'm not mistaken. I don't remember. Okay. But yeah. Okay. And then I'll reach out to Michelle for the water park team member piece of it. Because I think their titles get all wonky depending on. Oh, it's, it's. Yeah. I mean they did the consolidation too, like when they were eliminating titles and stuff. And I think honestly, I don't know what they're called. I think they're all called guest experience agent. But it, it's a combination of lifeguards. Okay. And they all work different property do it different. Like the lakes, when I was on the call with them going over like what they need. They use all their lifeguards as cashiers. Okay. And lifeguards. And then they rotate them. And so I'm like, so who, who are cashiers? You're like, oh, everyone. Okay. So they all rotate them. So we may have a bigger group to train there because they. They rotate everyone. Okay. Okay. Now we also. We had talked about. So now you still want. We want to try and have everybody go through the E learning first before we deploy any in person training. Ideally last time we. Because then they don't do the. Then they don't do the elearning. Okay. So yeah, that would be ideal. Yeah. So does that work? So I know, I know our date was 9 8. Is that 98 for. For customer. For guests to start entering the water park and everybody be trained by. Or is that 9 8? We want to start training. 9 8. We want to start training. Okay, gotcha. And we'll just give ourselves a week. So. Okay. Which we may not need last time was like two days. So maybe they could start on Friday. And just by looking at. I just got a report right now from the analytics team that does tableau and every single property is actually using the water park feature already. What? Yeah, not well, all the properties that have water park. So. Okay, so for example, like let's see. Smokey issued 16 vouchers in the last week. We don't need no stinking training. Towers. Issued six fillers, issued 154, tungsten 180. Okay, so the feature is there. I mean, the feature is there, right? So I reach out to Kayla. I'm like, hey, are you using it? He's like, honestly, I kind of use it sometimes because it's just there and it's so easy. Okay, but I'm like, kayla, but what. But why would anybody on a non water park property be hitting the issue button? Because that means. That means somebody's handing them a wristband when they hit issue, correct? No, this is just a report showing how many were issued per property, not showing who issued it overall. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So. All right, well, the training should be really quick. At least they like it. Yeah, they're already using it. Do I need to talk to Faith then about having somebody at all these properties? And then if we're doing three properties simultaneously, how do we want. Do we want to prioritize? I know we have. Don't we have someone at. What's her name? Danny and Smokey? Can she do Smokey? I can talk to Fate and then. Just someone at Ranch. Okay, and who's responsible for which resorts? Hold on. Between Mia and. I'll get it wrong. I just know their big property. I never can remember their small properties. Hold on. Isn't that the Summit? The Summit is on the eight, right? Summit. It sure is. We can't do that. Where is it? Is it the Lakes? Is that the Villas? Damn. Should I cancel? I have a way out. I don't have to speak. I'm just kidding. Jared goes before me and then I go and then you. God damn it. It's always something giving you all the facts so you have them before you make a decision. Okay, fine. This is the last year for them. Every freaking year. Invite someone else. We just. We could take the two hours and do it together. It's me. Then you just combine the whole thing in two hours. I could. It's really from a training perspective, it's mainly for an office, so. Yeah. Would have to come up. We can come up with something. Yeah. All right. Sorry. That's okay. That just. The eight didn't put two and two together. It's the rollout day and the wow day. The wow Summit. Fun. Well, Bill, this is. It just. It will impact whoever is attending. I guess that wow. Yeah. Summit. Because I was gonna say I could just. I could be at the Lakes that day, but the summit, I mean, I could come over there after the summit but I know if Ray's doing it he likes to do the meetings early like he likes to do 9, 10 o'. Clock. But I guess it just depends on who. But we'll definitely need someone at River Ranch and someone at the lakes. Okay. And honestly the, the assistance that they need was really, it was more system related. Not the system messing up but user system assistance. Okay. Yeah. On the water park side or on. The, on the water park side. Okay. I can't log in. How do I like. Yeah, it was, it was mostly most of that that we dealt with. Okay. Yeah. There's definitely a module right at the beginning of the, of the training on how to like your sans account and all that. Yeah. So but they're still, you're still saying that kind of. I was surprised. I mean keeping people. I mean some of those team members, they, they're not that they're not around computers. Yeah. They have a cell phone but they've never linked. They've never had an account. Right. With Westgate. Right. They've never had to log into an email. They've never had to do any of that. I mean I've probably set up three accounts like as new account because they've never had an account, never had an email, nothing. Okay. So. So there, some of them is just going to be very new to logging into a Westgate computer. So that those were probably some of the assistance that they need. Okay. Do you still want to stick with 9899 is there. Is 98 a holiday? Like is 9 is no. 91. Okay. So yeah, I mean I'm good with. I don't know also what the team members schedules look like or anything like that. Let's do 99. That will probably help a little bit better because Morgan is normally off Monday, Tuesday. Sorry Sunday. Monday. So she'll be there on Tuesday. Okay. And I don't know if that's gonna change by then when they make all these changes. Yeah. So we'll do 99. And then for whoever's going to River Ranch is can they get everybody in one day? I have no idea the size of the team or when they're gonna have to spend multiple days going out to River Ranch. I think one day is fine. I met with the team, the front office team is very small and then I met with the water park team when I was out there. Okay. And it's not, it's not a big team. I think one day. I mean everybody else, the other ones are all local. Yeah. And I think we're given 99. I mean, yeah, we're giving them enough time if we send it out today. I'll send out an email to them today, which I think I. Let me talk to Faith first and just confirm that she's got that the trainers are available. Okay. And then I can let you know then. Yeah, but I'm not sending, like, trainers. Name just, like the dates. Right. Okay. I. Well, I had told them 98 two weeks ago. Or I'll send it to Michelle and have Michelle send it out to them. But. Yeah, so we should be good there. Okay. All right. I think that's. I think that's all the questions that I have for Water park at the moment. Okay. So water park. Check this. What. What else was on the agenda for. Your career path thing? I know I said I would do the on demand suggestions for each thing. I added those in. I just need to hyperlink them. Like, review links to the. Okay. Yeah. So like, for front desk, I did guest service fundamentals. I kind of kept it like 5 or less. I did guest service fundamentals. Handling difficult guest service scenarios and then resolving conflicts are good ones. For the advanced Front desk, I did time management essentials. So it does a guide to workplace integrity. Yes. For cft, Effective feedback strategies, A guide to mentoring others, and then a guide to legal. Perfect. And then Jen is. There's some of her left here because. I know you said they could either go into both or one or the other. Yeah. Business writing fundamentals, project management fundamentals, and then effective feedback strategies. That's one that overlaps. Yeah. Supervisor. Five leadership styles to influence a team. A leader's guide to resolving team conflict, Motivating your team Performance management essentials, and then leading.","📅 **Meeting Overview**:
The purpose of the meeting was to address job requisition processes, discuss checklist management, and finalize plans for upcoming training related to operational changes, particularly concerning golf cart and bell staff roles, front desk operations, and water park functionality.

🎯 **Key Decisions Made**:
- Golf cart attendant requisitions will remain open in a combined manner rather than creating separate records, despite system challenges.
- Consolidated checklists for Guest Relations and other roles will remain as is until the new NA system update in Q4 2025.
- Job change profiles will no longer include the Resort Ops Day 1 checklist to prevent redundancy.
- Agreed to introduce a survey feature at the end of elearning modules for further feedback.
- Water park training will begin on September 9th for all relevant staff instead of September 8th due to scheduling conflicts.

📋 **Action Items**:
- **Trisha**: Continue efforts to adapt job requisition processes.
- **Team**: Finalize and review combined operational checklists post-NA rollout.
- **KP**: Update job change profiles by removing unnecessary Day 1 checklists.
- **Concerned Team Members**: Coordinate with Faith to confirm trainer availability for water park operational training.
- **Allison**: Email relevant ops teams about upcoming water park training.

💡 **Important Discussions**:
- Discussed inefficiencies in the current requisition system where past data cannot be tracked effectively, recognizing Trisha's challenges in implementing changes.
- Explored pros and cons of separating vs. combining bell staff and golf cart attendant roles.
- Talked through upcoming elearning module content and necessity for survey at module end.
- Reviewed operational differences across properties concerning water park management.

⚠️ **Risks & Issues**:
- The current requisition and checklist system lacks historical data capture, creating potential inefficiencies.
- There is uncertainty regarding system updates (NA) timing, affecting checklist finalization.
- Potential training redundancy if operational changes aren’t communicated effectively.

📅 **Next Meeting/Follow-up**:
- Follow up after the NA system update (Q4 2025).
- Check-in after September 9th to assess water park training outcomes.
- Continued discussions may be needed post-training and checklist implementation.","[{""title"": ""Finalize and combine checklists for Golf Cart and Bell Staff"", ""dueDate"": null, ""assignee"": null, ""category"": ""development"", ""priority"": ""medium"", ""description"": ""Combine the checklists into one, figuring out where there's overlap, and make it ready for when NA hits in Q4 2025.""}, {""title"": ""Revisit checklist status on 10/1"", ""dueDate"": ""2024-10-01"", ""assignee"": null, ""category"": ""review"", ""priority"": ""medium"", ""description"": ""Put a reminder to revisit and review the checklists and the NA feature status.""}, {""title"": ""Send well loyalty screenshots to Joanna"", ""dueDate"": null, ""assignee"": null, ""category"": ""communication"", ""priority"": ""urgent"", ""description"": ""Ensure the well loyalty screenshots are communicated to Joanna.""}, {""title"": ""Launch 'Who Pays What' by 9/28"", ""dueDate"": ""2024-09-28"", ""assignee"": null, ""category"": ""development"", ""priority"": ""high"", ""description"": ""Ensure 'Who Pays What' is launched by the specified date to align with the office national meeting.""}, {""title"": ""Plan Water Park Training Rollout"", ""dueDate"": ""2024-09-09"", ""assignee"": null, ""category"": ""training"", ""priority"": ""high"", ""description"": ""Coordinate with Faith regarding trainers for River Ranch and other properties.

She created a new hire. Her name is McKenzie, but we're not seeing her. So I don't know if you see her somewhere in your back end data. And I have her employee ID number as well. And when we try to re add her, it's giving us an error message because it's saying she already exists. But we can't see her anywhere. Okay. So let me. We could look at this together. Let me just share my screen so you guys could see the back end. Always love to see the back end. Don't work. I know. All right. Where is this table thingy? Oh, I hear her. I didn't realize. I figured something was on. I think she was in a mood earlier today. So it was just a new hire, a team member that got added. Correct. The CFT is Katie. And the new hire that she added, her name is Mackenzie or Kenzie. Kenzie. I'm not seeing it either. 8551-785517-85517. Yes. Yeah, it's not showing that it's added. But when you attempted to add her. Oh, right here. Oh, there it is. Okay. Damn. They added a lot of people after that. Wow. So she was added frontex Smoky Mountain Friendex agent. She. Why is she inactive? I could not see her on the My Manage access page. Unfortunately, to change that and I'm also having issues on that page. That was my second thing I was going to bring up. I cannot make any edits. I can go to the edit page, but there's no submit button. It doesn't lock it in or save it. But yeah, I don't think I saw her on my Manage. Why is this showing that she's inactive? That's weird. We deactivated her. It looks like on 7 21. Was she already in the system from. From way back? It looks like. And she's deactivated. Maybe you know how on the old. The old platform or the old layout, we could see deactivated team members? Yeah. I wonder if this was one of the tests that we did and we just left it deactivated because you can see deactivated team members now. And it kind of just left there. And we didn't reactivate that team member back. It could be. But it's showing that this team member was deactivated back in 721. It could be a test that we did. Honestly, that did that. So let me. Look at her higher date was July 18th. This team member here. Yeah. Someone def looked like the Deactivated button was hit. And I think back then we had the old. The old layout also. So it's this one. And it did trigger a duplicate, and it was deactivated by this person. Who is this? Okay. All right, so let me set the variable back to one. Can you check? Now she's showing up. I need to. I need to recreate this separate section for deactivated employees. But I'm gonna say this was. She may have touched the deactivated button without realizing back then. Okay. Yeah, I do see her now. Yeah. With progress for 30 days. Okay, I'll have her check and see. That's this one, right, mackenzie? Yes. Yeah, yeah. So that's what happened. I. I believe I'm gonna say on the old one and maybe on this one. You guys remember this one? Jacob? No, I mean, like, you remember this layout, right? Oh, yes. So we have all these deactivated option here. I'm thinking maybe she accidentally. Because that. That's been in there since July something. And maybe she accidentally hit that button without realizing or something, and it just kind of stay there in the back end. But because on the new version or the new layout, the deactivated or not the deactivated are not showing up here like on the old one, because I'm going to separate it and do like a separate page just for deactivated. So it doesn't cloud this up. Or I could probably add it as part of the filters here and just put all employees and then deactivated employees or something like that. So you want to see it here. So that's why. But on the other one, we were able to see deactivated employees on the same. So if I deactivated. And I'll. I'll take it back off. But I. If I deactivated. Kind of don't want to deactivate someone because it's going to show the record in the back end. But when I deactivated someone here, it still shows. It just have like a. A gray. Like a gray. What. What was it? It's like a gray highlighted looking. Yeah, but it still shows. But yeah, so that's. That's what it was. Okay, what was the second thing? The other thing that I had, like I said, in my Manage Access page, I'm specifically trying to change the department that a CFT is in. His name is Asael Gomez. And so when I found his profile, when I clicked Edit, he's just not Guest relations. And if I were to select a department, like, there's no save button on this One. There'S no say. Wow. Okay. I'll take these dogs over. Catastrophic ones. Oh my God. That's funny. There's no save button on the edit page. Okay. All right. Was that, was that the only two things? Yes. Okay. I think any other discussion will probably be all data related. So these are just these little things that the trainers are bringing to me. So. Okay, so far everything is working. As you can see, they're using it. The data's in there, which is good. Pushing for more observations with the trainers and everything. So. Okay. Yeah, no complaints on my end so far. All right, perfect. I did not do my job at all on Wednesday. Oh, unless they did. No. Do you guys want to go through that now? I'm, I'm doing it. I'm starting to look at it on the side right now. Yeah. Okay. I, I didn't know if you wanted to wait because you didn't understand the email or. No, I just didn't. I just didn't do my thought. Okay. Yeah, no, you're right. I was actually. Yeah, I was waiting on the. Yeah, what you said. Okay, so it's good to go. So I can do it now, but I was, I was waiting. Okay. Of course. All right. I mean we could go through them together really quick if you want. I mean, it may take the rest of the call. No, I mean, I can do them. I, I was thinking about what we might need to show on Wednesday. So we need to show copies of the observations. We'll need to show like maybe the 3016-90s. So the observations on 36 and 90s are good. So is there any dashboard that you're comfortable kind of showing yet to the gms? I mean we could show them pretty much everything here. I think the, the, this, the 369 dashboard is fine. Yes. I still may need to go back through and make some changes like these. I haven't done these yet, but I'll have that ready by, by Wednesday. I think this dashboard is fine because I don't think any gym is going to look at the numbers and be like, oh, that's incorrect. Right. Just the idea behind the dashboard. So I think this is fine to show them. Which ones are changing and not the performance is changing. 3060 dashboard. Yeah. Oh, hold on. Round one. I should put those menus over there too. So onboarding satisfaction. We're going to keep the percentage here. The last time we discussed, these are going to change to 10 same. So we're not editing any of the 30, 60, 91 so the actual, the actual onboarding satisfaction is 3.8 out of 10. No, because remember the. This measurement first was 1 to 5. I believe we had changed three questions. We change. I don't remember the specific question, but I remember was question 8, 9 and then on the 90 day we change question 6 also. 6, 8, 9 and 10. I believe so, yeah. So just like the observation where we have to go back in and make those five, ten, those threes five or however we want to do it, we may have to do the same thing. Also one of the questions I think is the confidence. It was more on a. I don't think it was on a number scale. It was maybe in the back end I was, I was. It was saving as number but it was. Or the feedback. I think it was the feedback. It was positive, negative, whatever. And we also change it too. So now it's looking for a number and it's not looking for that word. I think it was the feedback. So we got to find that one. And I believe it was this one, if I'm not mistaken. Or are this one. I gotta look at it again. Or maybe this one is the same. Because we're going to change the performance observations. But we weren't. We didn't have a plan to change the 30, 60 90s. No, no, we did not. So but I think most of these will stay the same. Hold on. So the question that we changed. Let me just actually go back to them real quick so I could understand. So for the 30 and 60, we change confident retention. No, we did 10 too. Right. Our 10 was already like that. So. So that's perfect. So now we just got to go back sa and see what the old database had and I could probably do those too. But we just got to go back in now and see what the old database had because a 10 would be a 5, a 3 would be not. Yeah, a 5 would be a 10, a 3 would be a 5. Right. So if we look at the back end for some of these 36 to 90, then it's going to have scoring from 1 to 5 when it should be from 1 to 10. So we got to make those changes. So the dashboard is going to show. Is always going to show. Why do I keep going to observation? The dashboard is always going to show out of five. So like the performance is one, the confidence is one and the retention. Right. Because these were initially one to five. So it's doing it out of five, it needs to do it out of ten and this is probably up to eight because we probably have had some new scores. Our new survey with, with the 1 to 10 scale. So it's, it's the numbers up there a little bit more. But we still need to go in and make some changes to the old ones. And I can bet if I look at, if I look at the database, it's probably saying the same thing. So if I go to the 369 database, so I could just look at the date. But yeah, so you're gonna have 5 and 10. So all these looks like they're new. Everything in August. And then. Hold on. Oh, so we only have 13. Okay. I also can't get to the completed surveys to edit them. I can't figure out how to get to those. I don't think. I don't perform the observations or the 30, 16, 90. I don't think I had an edit option for the 36 to 90. Did I create. I don't remember if I created one. I know I created an edit option for the observation. Where can I go to the old observations to edit them? Not the old one. Well, so if you go to. If you go to observation here and you open, say like this person. If you open it right, and you scroll to the bottom, there's an edit option here. Okay, got it. No problem. But read the email so you understand, because the one that says not measurable is really observed, unless on the. In the database, it's not measurable, if that makes sense. A little confusing. Oh, okay. Damn. Yeah. Oh, sorry, I was unmuted. I got to the next time. Like, hopefully we don't have to make any more, like, changes like that. But the next time I probably need to, like, download the database, export it to Excel, have it before I go in and do these changes. Just the email. I think you were at it. I don't know why the search name is not coming up. That's weird. Let me close this for a little bit and reopen it. I don't know why my email is acting like this. You're in the old outlook. I never switch. But it never used to act like this because I have so much crap open. You prefer the new one? Okay. This is it right here. Yeah. All right. So you guys got this email, right? Yeah. Okay, so basically, if it's. If it's not measurable, which is going to be 10, you're going to change not measurable to observe. Unless it's marked as NM in the data set, which is the sheet right here. See? Attach. Then keep it as not measurable. And I'll show you what that means in a sec. If it says not observe, we're going to keep it as not observed. If it says observe, we're going to change it to not observe. All right, so let's go through. Let's go through the first one. So I could kind of show you guys what I'm. What I mean. So this Excel sheet is the old database before we Change everyone from 1, 2, 3, NM to observe, not observe, which in the back end is really 10, 0 and NM following? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, sure. Okay. All right. I mean, I understand the changes. I'm just spending more time relating it to the actual observation. All right, so let's, let's. Let's go through that. So if. So this is the new. This is what we want it to be. Right? So this is going to be. Or what is it? What it is now? So this is the new version. So if it's a 10, then it's observe. If it's a 0, then it's not observe. So this is Yegord right now. Or is Yegord. Is Yegord real? Yeah, so let's. Let's do that one together. So I'm gonna. I'm gonna walk through that one with you so you could understand what I'm saying. So it's the one that I have highlighted in. In y. These. Right? So this is. This is the new. This is how we have it now. So this is the old one. So three would be 10, right? Observe. The first one for eboard. So this would be zero. One would also be zero. So these would be not observed. This would be the same. And then this would be N M. Does that make sense? Needs to be observed. Unless it's nm in the sheet. Correct. So, dang, what did she measure from this person? So, but do you guys understand this so far make sense? Yeah. You're gonna go into eboards. Yes. Yeah. All right, so I'm gonna put them side by side. And then. So this is. Come on. Okay, so let's start from the top. So why God? All right, so we're looking at this observation. So let's start with general question number one. Right? So general question number one for why God? Ibor Igor. Got a three, right? So they got a three. So a three back then is converted to a ten. Observe. So this should be. So let's edit real quick. So the first four should be observed. Are you changing it or you want me to change it? Okay, so the first four should be observed, right? So 1, 2, 3, 4, and then the next three should be not observed because 2, we're doing zero. Also like it. We didn't have a. We didn't have a description. It was just 2, 1, 2, or 3. And then NM. We didn't have, like, a description to it. Like observe, not observe. Should it be something on the center? Like, would it lower the scores overall if you made that zero, too? Oh, yeah. You have to have this be a zero, one or a two, right? Huh. So what we're saying. So a two in the old system was like, we kind of saw it, but it needs work. But in the new system, we either observed it or we didn't. Correct. So what do we want group that score to be? Does that go to zero or does that go to observed? Because there is no longer like, oh, it needs work. Right. What do you want to put that under? Do you want to put it under observe or. Or not observe? How many entries do you have so far that would be changed by this? Every single observation. Observation that was done before. It's the ones in front of you, Ray? Yeah. Yeah. Pretty much everything that was done before August, all the observations. So there's only like, what, a dozen in here? Yeah, probably. Yeah. Okay, so it doesn't sound like a change in these scores would be that big of a variable to consider. No, I would say we leave it at zero. What are y' all thinking? I agree with that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So not observed in will not move. Is that correct, Omar? Yeah. So we'll leave these as not. So. Yeah, and that's kind of what I put. Not observe will just stay not observe. So that's what you put in your email. I agree with. Yeah. 1, 2, 3, 4, which is this 1, 2, 3, 4. And then we have 1, 2, 3 that are twos, which is 1, 2, 3. And then if you realize also. So we have the 1, 2, 3, which is twos, but this one, which is general question number we do. So it needs to be observe because it's a three. And then the first. So now we're in the SA role. The first role, roll one is showing three, but it's showing NM here. So that's why I meant by if it's showing NM, just check to make sure it's not actual NM. But if it's a 3, then you move it to observe. Little confusing. And then the second role question is also a three. So it's going to be observe. And then there is a not observe, which is number three, but it's shown as an nm. Oh, that's kind of off. And then number. Hold on, I got confused. Let's go back up. So three. So that's correct. No, this should. So hold on. Now let's see what you guys waited for me. Okay, so three, two, two, three. So roll. So this is three. Two should be not observed. And then roll three. This should be observed. So this is what it looks like. Yeah, but because these are all two back in the days like so unless you want to switch these sa to observe. But yeah, because this would have. These would. Most of these would have been two which would have helped the score because right now this score is 4.7. Being that. Right. Faith, I know I lost you guys like five minutes ago, but that really makes me think now it's just back up, man. Oh, what are we thinking? Can we go to the top really quick? One more? Yeah. So the all of the not observed because in this instance Mia really didn't get to see a lot. No, I guess that's fair. Okay, so scored a 2.5 on their role specific observation out of 10. So this is going to highlight a lot I think in the, in the properties. But this person was being observed. But remember this is based on a three or four scale scoring where back then we were also looking for somewhat incompliant. Right. Oh maybe they have everything on. But I don't know. Well I don't know what they were looking at at that time. But the two would suggest that they are incompliant 90. But something is missing. That's why they got a two. Yeah. So exactly. Right. So like what Omar is saying and one placement really like where we would want to like if the training specialist sees that that's like horrific checking. Right. And I don't know, you know, I know we're going back and forth on like how we measure and how we put non measurable or not, you know, so maybe it doesn't show as bad. But like that's one where you step in, you walk into the back and you're like Jeff, you won't believe what I just saw. Like you need to take care of this right away. So I don't know, you know that's just kind of what I'm what I was thinking there with this. So I don't know because I mean. This two could mean because again these were two. So it's not like they just. Maybe in this one they, they confirmed the room type but they didn't confirm the rate. What's the comment on this? Because I wonder if this came up when Danny had mentioned that all of our observations right now are check in specific. And if this wasn't like granted, I wouldn't have had her fill this out if it wasn't an actual check in. But I wonder if it was disclosed. Anywhere in the comment. But she, but if that happens, Faith, we just put not measurable because then the scoring will ignore that. It won't count that against them. So again, this one might have been just in the early days where we're learning how to fill out still. But as we get further in, right. Like you know, if you, if there's no chance to even score this, it's not fair. Right. We put not measurable here. Right. Omer, this is calculating, this is ignoring not measurable for the calculations at the top, right? Yeah, yeah, it is, it is. So it's. This is scoring out of 19 rather than out of 22 because three were not measurable. Yes. I have to offer my four o'. Clock. So I would say think about this. I mean you guys let me know, I could probably work on most of them. You want to keep it like this. Just train the training specialist on any. Any further that we want to. We want to look at. Yeah, it's not going to help us nor you Omar, as a compliance of this. Right, so. Yeah, I agree. I'll take care of these though, if you, if you consider taking care of the 3060 90s, I'll take care of these. Okay, I understand now. And I wrote down some extra notes for myself. So I'll get these changed today. Okay. There, there. So but based on what I did here, like it's. It should be self explanatory. I mean all the threes will be observed because the threes would equate to 10 in how we're doing it now. Twos and ones would be zero and NM would be NM. There are about three. Three team members or three observation that that is missing. I. I got to look for the database, the backup database that have those three. But other than that, everyone else is there in that Excel sheet. Can you, can you. I gotta drop 4 o'. Clock. Can you do 3 to 4 tomorrow for me and you, Omar? Yes. Yeah, I should be on to number three to four. Let's see. All right. Ray, Faith, you don't have to go to this one that you're about to get the email for. Actually hold on. Can we do four? Actually I could do three to four. I could move this to four. I have a one on one in Cocoa Beach. But yeah, yeah, let's do three to four. Yeah. All right. Yeah. All right. All right. So. Right. Faith, you're about to get this, but you don't need to be at this meeting. This is just me. No more talking about the presentation on Wednesday. Okay. All right, Bye. All right. Good to be sure. Thank you. Cool. Was there anything else that you guys had? It's sa. It's. Good, man. How are you? It's. SA. Hello? Hi. Hi. Are you busy? No, I can. I can listen. What's up? No, I can listen. I'm just typing or finish finishing up a code. About Jul. I've been annoyed all day. And then she. Me too. You what? Did you read Julie's email? No, I haven't checked my email in a little bit. She said there's an update coming for September. As of now, it looks like the 10th. It could slide back to the 24th depending on the rest of development testing. Our next scheduled call. Our next social meeting is the fifth, and I'm sure that won't be enough time to get info put together. Would you like me to look at time this week for us to touch back on the new feature? Yeah. What if it's the same feature that. Do you know that? That's what it is. I mean, that's what she told me. It was just a receipt printed. I mean, it's just where to go to print the receipt. But I. We didn't get into details. I don't think she know those details when I spoke to her a few weeks ago. So I guess it's not that big of a deal. But. Yeah, well, I mean, if you want to set up something. If you want to set up something, I mean, we could. I mean, do you just want to ask her? Do you want to respond to the email and say, all right, thank you, sir? Yeah, when I. Yeah, I'll probably write to it later or once I finish this. But yeah, I could just say I. I believe based on what we discussed, this is not. This doesn't require like major training or something because it's just print. Just a print receipt. The receipt feature being added or something like that. Yeah. So I can reply. You say, I. I believe this one should be fairly easy and doesn't require a. Like an actual whatever since it's just the receipt being added is just how to print the receipt. But I. You guys don't work. You don't. You don't work on their training manual. Right. Because I believe Kathleen has all those information already or all those screenshot. Well, that's part of the problem with Johanna and sa. I mean, I want to say. No. Okay. As part of the problem. And that's something I tried to very tactfully bring up to her on our call last week without saying, like, this before, but I was like, you guys have stuff in way too many places. I think your bigger problem, like, wow, is is that if I need to find something, I can go to two different places to find it, and all 10 of those places may not be updated. I was like, you want to think about the last email you sent? You put in all these locations. Like, you shouldn't be updating things in all those locations. Like, if you have a wow. SharePoint, like, why do you also think you need the documentation? Like, that separate documentation of a book? Like, that's time license. I just don't really understand. Then we have a training, and then our training, like, update. Just the amount of money being spent to, like, keep materials updated for a while, in my opinion, is a little crazy. And it should all live in one place. But no, that's why we wouldn't create a manual for them. This was a whole thing when Victor was here. Because again, it did not. It didn't make sense. Right? Like, hold on. Sorry. I'm getting, like, three different texts based on the thing that I'm working on. Huh. I was just gonna answer them now. Like, I have. I have, like, four emails. Two of them that. Because the way I'm going to reply to it, I'm like, hey, I believe LND has Kathleen from. LND has all these screenshots already if you want to reach out to her. Okay. Yeah. Tell me what the email says. You'Ll be. You want me call you on teams? Yeah. All right, let me do that. Okay. It. Hello? Okay. Oh, that was loud. I'm sorry. I was laughing at my team. Sorry. They're, like, yelling across the hall. Right before I. All right, so this one I need Diane. That I could do later. So this one from Julie. So they sent an email, and of course, you know, she include everyone. Diana, Sheena. I'm currently reviewing the World Loyalty Training Guide and notice that we still have images from Mr. Sums. We need new screenshots from FriendX console to update the guide. Is there a way to. To access FDC for these images? Please let me know. If not, could you or your team assist with the attached document? And then she's like, omar, is this something you want to handle or something you need my team to handle? So it was originally from Joanna. So let me see the attached document. It. I think Valeria has.","📅 **Meeting Overview**: The meeting was held to resolve issues related to employee data management, specifically addressing the failure to add a new hire, Mackenzie, to the system. Discussions also covered performance observations and data accuracy for employee feedback and satisfaction tools.

🎯 **Key Decisions Made**:
- Mackenzie was identified as inactive due to a previous accidental deactivation, preventing her re-addition.
- Decision to create a separate section for inactive employees to prevent future confusion.
- Agreement to adjust the scoring system for past observations from a 1-5 scale to 1-10 for uniformity.

📋 **Action Items**:
1. **Resolve Mackenzie’s Employment Status**: Reactivate Mackenzie by modifying her system status.
   - Owner: Omar
   - Deadline: Immediate
2. **Create a Separate Section for Deactivated Employees**: Ensure deactivated records are easily accessible.
   - Owner: Omar
   - Deadline: By next update cycle
3. **Adjust Observation Score System**: Update past scores from old scale to current scale.
   - Owner: Omar & Team
   - Deadline: Before next review meeting
4. **Dashboard Preparation**: Prepare a consistent display of past and current employee satisfaction metrics.
   - Owner: Faith & Ray
   - Deadline: By Wednesday presentation

💡 **Important Discussions**:
- **Employee Data Error**: Inability to view Mackenzie due to backend errors and discuss potential system adjustments.
- **Observation Adjustment Concerns**: Debate on converting old observation data to align with current scoring standards.
- **Documentation Management**: Concerns raised over the inefficient storage and update processes for training and operational manuals, suggesting a streamlined information system.

⚠️ **Risks & Issues**:
- **System Backend Errors**: Errors in employee status management could lead to operational inefficiencies.
- **Inconsistent Data Representation**: Misalignment in observation score scales may lead to inaccurate data interpretation.
- **Document Management Discrepancies**: Inconsistent and duplicated location of operational manuals might cause confusion and redundancy.

📅 **Next Meeting/Follow-up**:
- **Date**: Collateral tasks review on [next scheduled meeting], Tuesday 3-4 PM.
- **Preparation**: Finalize all updates on employee data and observation adjustments. Prepare dashboards for GM presentation.","[{""title"": ""Investigate and resolve backend issue for new hire McKenzie"", ""dueDate"": null, ""assignee"": null, ""category"": ""development"", ""priority"": ""high"", ""description"": ""Look into the backend data to resolve the error where McKenzie appears inactive and cannot be re-added to the system.""}, {""title"": ""Recreate section for deactivated employees"", ""dueDate"": null, ""assignee"": null, ""category"": ""development"", ""priority"": ""medium"", ""description"": ""Create a separate section or filter for viewing deactivated employees in the new version of the employee management system.""}, {""title"": ""Fix edit feature on Manage Access page"", ""dueDate"": null, ""assignee"": null, ""category"": ""development"", ""priority"": ""urgent"", ""description"": ""Ensure the submit button is available and functional when editing department details on the Manage Access page.""}, {""title"": ""Prepare and finalize presentation dashboard"", ""dueDate"": ""2023-11-01"", ""assignee"": null, ""category"": ""development"", ""priority"": ""high"", ""description"": ""Make necessary changes to the 30-60-90 days dashboard to ensure it accurately reflects data before showing it to General Managers.""}, {""title"": ""Edit and correct observation scores"", ""dueDate"": ""2023-11-01"", ""assignee"": ""Faith"", ""category"": ""development"", ""priority"": ""high"", ""description"": ""Review and correct observation scores by adjusting old scores to comply with the new system of observed and not observed values.""}, {""title"": ""Review and update training guide images"", ""dueDate"": null, ""assignee"": ""Omar"", ""category"": ""other"", ""priority"": ""medium"", ""description"": ""Coordinate with L&D or obtain screenshots from FriendX Console to update images in the World Loyalty Training Guide.""}]",dde53e65-d861-4340-b0a6-3417e0e7b290,2025-08-26 18:53:12.060863,f,,1,,,

Does that make sense? Like so in talent acquisition, you're not supposed to do that. Every wreck should be a new wreck so that you have historical data on those, but it's not. Golf cart attendant is one wreck and everyone is hired into that one wreck. I see, I see. So it's always the wreck always gonna be. Yeah, right. You see what I'm saying? Yeah. But it shouldn't be like that. You should be able to see that. I had five golf cart attendant wrecks and this is the history of all of those wrecks. That's really how it should work. And Trisha's been trying to get that changed for a while, but I don't think our systems would allow us to do that or something. And so that's what's happening is that when they're asking them to open that position, if it's somebody, it's up here, it's up here. Vi says all of their information is up here. They don't write anything down. Oh. But that really speaks to some of the things that Westgate. That's the problem in TA is that because they turn over those team, those recruiters so often, somebody just wouldn't know and they would just back for the wreck. That's what's happening. So Trish is going to have to figure out a way to get that. Like. Yeah, I don't know what she's going to be able to do there, but. Okay. Okay. So. So we're good with those three checklists I'm sending them. I was just going through them in the, in the LMS to make sure that they were built properly. And so we're good with those three titles. So Guest Relations, Guest Experience and Resort Services Operator. Hold on, what was the second one? Guess. Guest gem. Oh, Jim. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes. Okay. Golf cart and Bell Staff. We're gonna leave it how it is for now. As in. As in we're not turning them on. We'Re not putting them, we're not separating them. Okay. Oh, we're not separating. Right. We're gonna leave it how it is. Bell services for now. There's. There's equally the same pros and cons with separating them and keeping them together. Spoke to pretty much everyone again from the gyms that would be affected, the department leaders that would be affected, hr. And. I mean the pros and cons, we're looking at more of a elevated department. Right. And if we bring in team members that are more guest facing, then it will elevate the department a little bit more. However, the plan, if we keep it. So we're just going to keep it would be. And that's one of the conversation I had with HR this morning. How does. How do we promote this position? Right. Because it's a. It's like a multi job position. How do we promote it? And then when we hire someone for the field and that would be up to me. How do we. How do we decide who goes where? Right. So what we've came up with was that when we hire someone, the position is going to be post as best services and then it's going to say like golf cart duties and then bell services, bell staff or something like that. Right. And the description will be for golf cart. So that's kind of what we discussed this morning. And so we still want to hire them to do that specific area, whether it's golf cart or bell staff. However, their training is going to be everything together right now. If they're in bell staff because that's what they're hired for and they. And we need help in golf cart, then they'll go to. Then they'll help. Right. So that's. That's kind of how we're approaching it. Okay. So is the thought that we want to then combine the two checklists into one. Yes. And figure out where there's overlap and do we want to do this now? So it's just sitting there ready, waiting to go or are we going to wait until we see the na actually hit and they. And then discuss how. How that impacts the checklist? Because this is the one where we can really use. Yes, this is the one we could. Really use any on this one. So did we. Did we tell you that it got moved from 2026 to scoops instead of. It's gonna be in Q4 of 2025. Things just told. Could be December, could be November. Yeah. Should we hold off? Because right now I rewrote it as if there was no N A. So I pulled out anything that was specific to golf cart because of the. The properties that don't have golf carts. Yeah, but how would the properties with golf cart operate? Because it's general enough that says. So that was that. Was that because they're very. The properties with golf cart. The golf cart trainings are very specific. So all I changed was I pulled out the two lines about golf cart training that were on day two. And it just says complete any additional CP training, practical exams and practice as required by your property. Okay. So that it just doesn't so it would. You'd have to keep with whatever record keeping you currently for the practical exam you wouldn't be able to use the lms. What about further down on that checklist where it goes over? There's two different other items. The Learn golf cart inspection, cleaning and maintenance. Learn out of service golf cart ticket. Those are all actually hot sauce items. When I spoke to Shane, he said that all those items except for like the, the cleaning and maintenance part, but the tickets, the sign out procedure, the check in procedure, all that are hot sauce items. So I was shoving them under there. Not completely. Okay, so the lakes for. For inspection and all those. Yes. For, for the lakes they use a different program to sign out. They have like a golf cart program that they use to sign out. But for the inspection and all that everyone use between the villas and the lakes they do use hot sauce. But for signing and signing out golf card, they use a different program at the lakes. Okay. And I think we had put like other. Our programs or something like that there. I don't remember. Any golf cart. I had shoved them all under hot sauce so that I can, I can pull them back out. And then. So then do we want to reinstate everything as it. As it was before and then just wait for the N.A. put any golf cart items that were on the golf cart attendant checklist that weren't already on bell services. I just, I feel like once we get the NA you may have to go back in. Right. That's why I'm like. And just kind of readjust. Four months. They didn't say. The problem is, is that they didn't say when in Q4. So I mean we're a month from Q4. Right. But. Right, Ari? Yeah. Yeah, pretty much. I mean who's Ryan Gaines? I have no idea. Westgate person. Yeah, he's. Email me me about Tablo Access. I don't. Table access. Rental revenue from Westgate. Grand Central from New York. Ryan Gaines. Oh, I know. Yes. At this rate, are we getting that Checklist out on 91? No. No. So at this rate, I don't mind. There's a possibility with the 10 one. I don't know if that's even on a work day, but the 101 release. We could ask Belinda on our next call. Like where is this at in Q4? I would just wait to be honest because you're. I don't want to, but that's just going to be double world. Okay, so let's go over it again. Once we know the NA Is. Yeah. Are just Created now with NA in mind. So once we get the na, you don't have to worry about, like, recreating anything and combining it. Hopefully. Hopefully. And combining it will kind of make it easier for you too. I mean, it's kind of one checklist like that, Dex, on the computer screen. I don't know who drew that. That's pretty cool. Okay, so I'll leave that. I'll just put a tickler thing in the file to revisit the checklists on 10.1 and find out where we are with the NA feature and how the jobs have all spun out. And can we all agree on. Yeah, that belongs to the checklist. Yeah. All right, so I think that's it about checklists. Okay. The only thing we were just. I was just mentioning to Adam is that it looks like all the job change profiles also include the Resort Ops Day 1 checklist. And they should not. Right. Say that again. The profiles that we use to assign courses for job change, because we have to assign them to new hires one way and job changes to the other. The job change ones include the Resort Ops Day 1 checklist. Now, if you're changing jobs, should you have done everything that's in that Resort Ops day one already and that you don't need that checklist again? So you're going from corporate to resort op. Okay, so then there's going to be overlap there, though, because in the corporate security and the one. The day one for corporate that Chris and I did like that I started. And security, it's basically the same thing. If you have adp, stuff like that, like the majority of it's the same. Yeah. Like instead of meeting gm, it's like meeting your department leadership. Instead of property tour, it's like building. Tour. Stuff like that. Throwing it out there because they would need those things. But. Nothing can ever. I mean, we could go back all of those. Well, it's a whole. It's a whole separate course that they have to do. So I feel like you would want to just remove it if you're not. If there's anything to sign it if you're transferring. Like, if I'm a resort, let's say I'm on Omar's team, but then I go to like housekeeping. Is there a way to. It's only going to understand that the. That tiling is going to not stuff that they're coming from. Yeah. So if you're going from resort to. Resort, it's a duplicate. I would just say leave it off. Okay. So that. That's A change that has to be then made to all the existing profiles. So do you want to change it? What do you mean? So if I go in already, I probably shouldn't have brought this up. Today feels like a Friday and it's only Tuesday so probably not. So if I look at job teams. So here's characters and if I go over here because this is such a stupid thing. Sorry. So I'm changing jobs. I do the welcome to Resort Ops and the animated character performance checklist. So do we still want them to do welcome to Resort Operations? It's built into every job change profile. So KP would have to go in and delete them all. Can you just turn them off? She can, she can delete. She'd have to delete out that class. She can't turn it. She would want us to leave it running. But she'd just have to delete that class. It's not a big deal to delete the one class but I just didn't want to. I just noticed it today when I was, when I was fixing the ones when I was sending her the information for Omar and I was like ah crap. Can we just ask, can we bringing this back up and bring it up with Alex. Okay. I just don't want to make decisions about reserve ops without him. Okay. Moving on. Quick hit things. The well loyalty screenshots. All good. Did you want. All good. Okay. So you're good. You're going to send them to Joanna? Already did. Spoke to her this morning. Who pays what is is still uncharged to go out. So I think you wanted to launch it the 28th. Yes. So the reason for that is I have my meeting on the 20th, my front office national meeting on the 29th. Okay. So I just want to show it to them real quick and show it to them there at the meeting. Okay. Yeah, we did. We did decide to trial a survey on the end of it. So there will be one extra thing. So it's going to be the elearning the chart and then just a five question survey and it's just a tiny experiment and then we'll figure out strategy going forward for how we would want to if we want to scale it. Okay. So that's that. Yeah. I realized I did not have a clue what you guys were talking about the other day. That's right. I did kind of grab you as you were walking down the hall. I was really mad at that point too. I did talk to Alex a bit. Got his perspective. His is a little different. We talked a little bit about it. Okay, so we'll make sense. Scale it off every time. Water park at some ridiculous hour of the morning. I sent you to water park. I saw that. I'm look at the head but I'm. Like these are going out yesterday bled into today. But what do you call. So I don't know if you want to go over those or if there was other stuff that. That that's all that I had because needs to get out the door. So. So, so I can move on to the other stuff if you wanted to go over those or if you wanted. If there was other stuff that you had on your agenda. No, I think that was it. Did Julie respond and say that that's what the meeting is about? Oh, I was going to say that Friday at 2:00'. Clock. Yeah. What was she thinking? Wait, she said that meeting at 2 o'? Clock? Yes. I didn't see that I was Friday. Of a holiday weekend. What was, what was the reply from her though? Did she say I don't think any. Of them are on the email because. When I originally Elite. Hold on. Responded to her, took everybody off. Am I yes to this or not? Oh, she just said sounds good, I'll get something on the calendar. So she didn't really answer if it's the. I'm gonna go into the holiday weekend. Pissed off. If it's the release. But if it's the receipt, I'm sure it's a receipt release. And okay. Honestly I don't think you need to put anything together for that. Okay. Okay. Okay, cool. It's. And if you do, it's something really simple. Okay. Where to go, where to click print. Okay. I saw the one for. I figured out where the one was for for folios. So when I saw. It's just because kind of you hit the little three dots and yeah. You hit receipt. And I mean if it's, if it's. It's for the 50 hold or the hold whole. I'm assuming it would be somewhere under the whole section. Right. I mean that would probably be the best place to put it. So I don't, I don't see a lot of training needed for that. Okay. It seems like it's just an email and it's just gonna hound yeah you or me until something. So she has proof that they were. I'll just send out normally send out that email. They were informed. So that was the only other thing that I had. And then yeah, it's just water park. So I did. Did front desk agent and I did front Desk managers first. The front desk managers would take the front desk agent course and the front end. The front desk manager course. The front desk manager will take the frontex agent course for. For water park. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. And then water park team members would just take their own, except for Smoky Mountain, who would have them take front desk agent and water park team members since they're going to be the ones issuing the. Yes. And I do think it's not necessary, but I do think the water park should take the water park, even though they're not going to be doing anything. Oh, the smoky water. The smoky water part. Because eventually. Okay, we may get them their own tablets and have them. Actually, they. I think they still need to take it as. Because if someone comes and say, hey, I didn't get, you know, fans or whatever, rather than coming back to the front decks, I would like for them to look it up right there rather than sending them back to the front decks. Okay. So you're going to equip them to be able to do that. Okay. I need to check in with River Ranch and the lakes. Well, I need to check in with Michelle to see if the water park. If the lakes and River Ranch have got their access yet and their devices. That's kind of her job. And if the. The link you send, if it's the Cook reference guide that you had and you just kind of put it there. I mean, I'm sure it's. I'm sure it's good to go. I jazzed it up a little bit. I gave it. I gave it a quiz at the end. Okay. So, yeah, I mean, it's all the same material, so it should be. It should be good. I'm trying to think if there was anything. Is it interactive or just. I started them out. It's not super interactive. I mean, there's some tabs and things that they can click on. There's a drag and drop. Okay. Some flip cards. I try to start out most of the lessons with a question and try and let them puzzle it out on their own first or take a guess at least, as opposed to just. Here's all the information. Right. So, you know, kind of that. More of that discovery type mindset as opposed to what you call. And it's set up just like. Just. It's in the same 360. It's kind of same idea as Megan's that you can make comments on. On the screens. So. Okay, cool. Anything. I'm gonna go through it because I was a little delirious here, so I know there's a typo or two that I couldn't find and I'm like, I don't care, they're going out anyway. That's right. So I'll just, I'll just go give it one more pass through and make sure. There was nothing that I was a little iffy on the wording. Okay. For that. And I know we never. You still haven't heard about the idea of that it doesn't matter if they're staying on their, their, their usage. So I was intentionally vague to kind of leave that. Yeah, yeah, I, yeah, I wouldn't get into that too much. They're just going to follow their current procedure and the current procedure right now if a owner that books outside of their week, outside of their account, if they can prove that they're an owner, we're still giving them the benefit. So if they book through Expedia Hotels.com we're still giving them all the benefits. If they can show, hey, I'm an owner with their phone or whatever, their, some of them still have their old card, we still give them the owner's benefit. Okay. Now just thinking of this, I know right now we're really focused on existing team members, but going forward, this will be something we can include in the whole new hire. We can add that whole onboarding thing the same way we're adding who pays. What is there going to be besides this, Are they going to get an introduction to water park policy in some other way or do we need to add any kind of policy information into this? We didn't add anything for the Frontex agent for water park. Right. This kind of came up after the checklist for water park. It says, it says it on, it just says the, like the day. It has like all the tabs. So I think the voucher tab is slash Water park is one of the checklist items. So it doesn't have any sub bullets. Or anything to explain it. No, but what you just said, Yes, I would love for it to be included, whatever, wherever it's going to be placed on the checklist. So when you get to it, that's going to be the lesson. Okay. Right. Yeah. And I think maybe that's the next step too is to start looking at some of these checklist items and turn them into E Learning. Okay. Yeah, absolutely. So, but, so is there anything I need to. So when you're, when you're going through the course, are there any policies and procedures related to water park that I need to add to the course that would that would benefit a new hire. So just to keep that in mind. You have to think about that. Let me ask Michelle too. I can't think of any, you know, most of the stuff that I'm thinking of, it's really specific to the water park, like entrance capacity in terms of how many people. Those are just stuff that the water park team members need to know for front decks. Not really, but I'll, I'll, I'll talk to her, Michelle, and see if there's anything. But I really can't think of anything really. And then in terms of assignments, should this also get assigned to resort services operators? The water park? Yes, because they may get a call that says, hey, and they, you know, the guest doesn't know who they're talking to. They dial zero. They think they're talking to the front desk when it's resort services. So they're like, hey, I checked in and can you check how many water park pass I have left or something? So at least they'll know how to check it in reserve services. So yeah. Okay. And they can't add anything the water park? Yeah, they can't. They wouldn't be able to add. You're not giving them any positions to add entries. Any permissions. Who did I give access from that? I think the managers does have access. I think. Think so. Okay, so we should add then the managers also to take the manager class and the front desk agent class. From resource services. Yes. Okay. Yeah, I think it's the manager. Did I add the supervisors? I think it's just the managers. And then what about guest relations? Do they need any access or do. They need any water? Oh, they do. They definitely do. And the same thing is it's split between guest relations agent and manager. Yes, because so in guest relations I just added the access recently, every single guest relations team member has access at the villas to override. Okay. Why? Because whenever sales have a new owner, they go to guest relations to get them access to the water park. So they should. So guest relations, agents and UP should take the. Both the, the agent and the. Yes. I said K's gonna love me when I try to explain how we're gonna. I mean you could just assign everything to all of front decks. Well, I don't want them to use if they're not. If they don't have the power to do something to do override. Tell them to do it. I see what you're saying. Yeah. Because friendx agent. Except Smoli. Otherwise the only one. Yeah. Have access to override do. Okay. So then hold on one second. Let me just. Both agent and manager. Okay. And then Smokey Smoke Weed said to said their water park people should also take the word for team member. Their front desk agents, they still have the same split between managers have to do the override things. Right. Okay. Okay. So they get. They get assigned same thing. They just also get the water park. Yeah. One to be able to do the issuing point. Correct part. Because it, it should be like the permission should be divided by role. Like it should be based on role. So whichever property should still be manager. I think supervisors are not. If I'm not mistaken. I don't remember. Okay. But yeah. Okay. And then I'll reach out to Michelle for the water park team member piece of it. Because I think their titles get all wonky depending on. Oh it's, it's. Yeah. I mean they did the consolidation too like when they were eliminating titles and stuff. And I think honestly I don't know what they're called. I think they're all called guest experience agent. But it, it's a combination of lifeguards. Okay. And they all work different property do it different. Like the lakes, when I was on the call with them going over like what they need. They use all their lifeguards as cashiers. Okay. And lifeguards. And then they rotate them. And so I'm like, so who, who are cashiers? You're like, oh, everyone. Okay. So they all rotate them. So we may have a bigger group to train there because they, they rotate everyone. Okay. Okay. Now we also. We had talked about. So now you still want. We want to try and have everybody go through the E learning first before we deploy any in person training. Ideally last time we. Because then they don't do the. Then they don't do the elearning. Okay. So yeah, that would be ideal. Yeah. So does that work? So I know, I know our date was 9 8. Is that 98 for. For customer. For guests to start entering the water park and everybody be trained by. Or is that 9 8? We want to start training. 9 8. We want to start training. Okay, gotcha. And we'll just give ourselves a week. So. Okay. Which we may not need last time was like two days. So maybe they could start on Friday. And just by looking at. I just got a report right now from the analytics team that does tableau and every single property is actually using the water park feature already. What? Yeah, not well, all the properties that have water park. So. Okay, so for example, like let's see. Smokey issued 16 vouchers in the last week. We don't need no stinking training. Towers. Issued six fillers, issued 154, tungsten 180. Okay, so the feature is there. I mean, the feature is there, right? So I reach out to Kayla. I'm like, hey, are you using it? He's like, honestly, I kind of use it sometimes because it's just there and it's so easy. Okay, but I'm like, kayla, but what. But why would anybody on a non water park property be hitting the issue button? Because that means. That means somebody's handing them a wristband when they hit issue, correct? No, this is just a report showing how many were issued per property, not showing who issued it overall. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So. All right, well, the training should be really quick. At least they like it. Yeah, they're already using it. Do I need to talk to Faith then about having somebody at all these properties? And then if we're doing three properties simultaneously, how do we want. Do we want to prioritize? I know we have. Don't we have someone at. What's her name? Danny and Smokey? Can she do Smokey? I can talk to Fate and then. Just someone at Ranch. Okay, and who's responsible for which resorts? Hold on. Between Mia and. I'll get it wrong. I just know their big property. I never can remember their small properties. Hold on. Isn't that the Summit? The Summit is on the eight, right? Summit. It sure is. We can't do that. Where is it? Is it the Lakes? Is that the Villas? Damn. Should I cancel? I have a way out. I don't have to speak. I'm just kidding. Jared goes before me and then I go and then you. God damn it. It's always something giving you all the facts so you have them before you make a decision. Okay, fine. This is the last year for them. Every freaking year. Invite someone else. We just. We could take the two hours and do it together. It's me. Then you just combine the whole thing in two hours. I could. It's really from a training perspective, it's mainly for an office, so. Yeah. Would have to come up. We can come up with something. Yeah. All right. Sorry. That's okay. That just. The eight didn't put two and two together. It's the rollout day and the wow day. The wow Summit. Fun. Well, Bill, this is. It just. It will impact whoever is attending. I guess that. Wow. Yeah. Summit. Because I was gonna say I could just. I could be at the Lakes that day, but the summit, I mean, I Could come over there after the summit. But I know if Ray's doing it he likes to do the meetings early like he likes to do 9, 10 o'. Clock. But I guess it just depends on who. But we'll definitely need someone at River Ranch and someone at the lakes. Okay. And honestly the, the assistance that they need was really, it was more system related. Not the system messing up but user system assistance. Okay. Yeah. On the water park side or on. The, on the water park side. Okay. I can't log in. How do I like. Yeah, it was, it was mostly most of that that we dealt with. Okay. Yeah. There's definitely a module right at the beginning of the, of the training on how to like your sans account and all that. Yeah. So but they're still, you're still saying that kind of. I was surprised. I mean keeping people. I mean some of those team members, they, they're not that they're not around computers. Yeah. They have a cell phone but they've never linked. They've never had an account. Right. With Westgate. Right. They've never had to log into an email. They've never had to do any of that. I mean I've probably set up three accounts like as new account because they've never had an account, never had an email, nothing. Okay. So. So there, some of them is just going to be very new to logging into a Westgate computer. So that those were probably some of the assistance that they need. Okay. Do you still want to stick with 9899 is there. Is 98 a holiday? Like is 9 is no. 91. Okay. So yeah, I mean I'm good with. I don't know also what the team members schedules look like or anything like that. Let's do 99. That will probably help a little bit better because Morgan is normally off Monday, Tuesday. Sorry Sunday. Monday. So she'll be there on Tuesday. Okay. And I don't know if that's gonna change by then when they make all these changes. Yeah. So we'll do 99. And then for whoever's going to River Ranch is can they get everybody in one day? I have no idea the size of the team or when they're gonna have to spend multiple days going out to River Ranch. I think one day is fine. I met with the team, the front office team is very small and then I met with the water park team when I was out there. Okay. And it's not, it's not a big team. I think one day. I mean everybody else, the other ones are all local. Yeah. And I think we're given 99. I mean, yeah, we're giving them enough time if we send it out today. I'll send out an email to them today, which I think I. Let me talk to Faith first and just confirm that she's got that the trainers are available. Okay. And then I can let you know then. Yeah, but I'm not sending, like, trainers. Name just, like the dates. Right. Okay. I. Well, I had told them 98 two weeks ago. Or I'll send it to Michelle and have Michelle send it out to them. But. Yeah, so we should be good there. Okay. All right. I think that's. I think that's all the questions that I have for Water park at the moment. Okay. So water park. Check this. What. What else was on the agenda for. Your career path thing? I know I said I would do the on demand suggestions for each thing. I added those in. I just need to hyperlink them. Like, review links to the. Okay. Yeah. So like, for Front desk, I did guest service fundamentals. I kind of kept it like 5 or less. I did guest service fundamentals. Handling difficult guest service scenarios and then. Resolving conflicts are good ones. For the advanced Front Desk, I did Time management essentials. It does a guide to workplace integrity. Yes. For cft, Effective feedback strategies. A guide to mentoring others, and then a guide to legal. Perfect. And then Jen is. There's some of her left here because. I know you said they could either go into both or one or the other. Yeah. Business writing fundamentals, Project management fundamentals, and then effective feedback strategies. That's one that overlaps. Yeah. Supervisor, Five leadership styles to influence a team. A leader's guide to resolving team conflict, Motivating your team Performance management essentials, and then leading.","📅 **Meeting Overview**:  
The meeting primarily focused on discussing Talent Acquisition (TA) processes, checklist consolidation for different job roles, and preparing for upcoming training related to water park operations. Several logistical and procedural updates were provided, with an emphasis on creating efficiencies and addressing current system limitations.

🎯 **Key Decisions Made**:
- Maintain the current combined checklist for Golf Cart and Bell Staff roles, rather than separating them.
- Implement a consolidated checklist that accommodates both Golf Cart and Bell Staff duties for cross-training purposes.
- Delay changes to the existing job change profiles until further discussion with Alex.
- Launch the ""Who Pays What"" on September 28th after a national meeting.
- Prioritize E-Learning completion before deploying in-person water park training.

📋 **Action Items**:
- Trish to explore ways to track Golf Cart Attendant wrecks separately.
- KP to delete redundant class in job change profiles for Resort Operations.
- Follow up with Alex regarding changes to job change profiles.
- Adam to finalize edits on checklists and revisit them on October 1st.
- Prepare water park training modules and assignments by September 9th, with a focus on E-Learning first.
- Faythe to coordinate availability of trainers for River Ranch and Lakes properties by checking with the respective managers.
  
💡 **Important Discussions**:
- The current system's inability to track separate wrecks for recurring positions like Golf Cart Attendants leading to loss of historical data.
- Consideration of combining checklists for efficiency and to aid broader training efforts.
- Readiness for deploying training ahead of the expected water park operations update in Q4 2025.
- Potential misalignment in scheduling upcoming meetings around holiday weekends.

⚠️ **Risks & Issues**:
- Potential resistance to checklist and procedural changes due to misalignments in current system capabilities.
- Overlap and redundancy in training materials needing review to ensure relevancy and efficiency.
- Possible logistical issues during training rollout due to insufficient understanding or preparation of technological access for some team members.

📅 **Next Meeting/Follow-up**:
- An additional meeting to discuss talent acquisition system capabilities and required changes.

She created a new hire. Her name is McKenzie, but we're not seeing her. So I don't know if you see her somewhere in your back end data. And I have her employee ID number as well. And when we try to re add her, it's giving us an error message because it's saying she already exists. But we can't see her anywhere. Okay. So let me. We could look at this together. Let me just share my screen so you guys could see the back end. Always love to see the back end. Don't work. I know. All right. Where is this table thingy? Oh, I hear her. I didn't realize. I figured something was on. I think she was in a mood earlier today. So it was just a new hire, a team member that got added. Correct. The CFT is Katie. And the new hire that she added, her name is Mackenzie or Kenzie. Kenzie. I'm not seeing it either. 8551-785517-85517. Yes. Yeah, it's not showing that it's added. But when you attempted to add her. Oh, right here. Oh, there it is. Okay. Damn. They added a lot of people after that. Wow. So she was added frontex Smoky Mountain Friendex agent. She. Why is she inactive? I could not see her on the My Manage access page. Unfortunately, to change that and I'm also having issues on that page. That was my second thing I was going to bring up. I cannot make any edits. I can go to the edit page, but there's no submit button. It doesn't lock it in or save it. But yeah, I don't think I saw her on my Manage. Why is this showing that she's inactive? That's weird. We deactivated her. It looks like on 7 21. Was she already in the system from. From way back? It looks like. And she's deactivated. Maybe you know how on the old. The old platform or the old layout, we could see deactivated team members? Yeah. I wonder if this was one of the tests that we did and we just left it deactivated because you can see deactivated team members now. And it kind of just left there. And we didn't reactivate that team member back. It could be. But it's showing that this team member was deactivated back in 721. It could be a test that we did. Honestly, that did that. So let me. Look at her higher date was July 18th. This team member here. Yeah. Someone def looked like the Deactivated button was hit. And I think back then we had the old. The old layout also. So it's this one. And it did trigger a duplicate, and it was deactivated by this person. Who is this? Okay. All right, so let me set the variable back to one. Can you check? Now she's showing up. I need to. I need to recreate this separate section for deactivated employees. But I'm gonna say this was. She may have touched the deactivated button without realizing back then. Okay. Yeah, I do see her now. Yeah. With progress for 30 days. Okay, I'll have her check and see. That's this one, right, mackenzie? Yes. Yeah, yeah. So that's what happened. I. I believe I'm gonna say on the old one and maybe on this one. You guys remember this one? Jacob? No, I mean, like, you remember this layout, right? Oh, yes. So we have all these deactivated option here. I'm thinking maybe she accidentally. Because that. That's been in there since July something. And maybe she accidentally hit that button without realizing or something, and it just kind of stay there in the back end. But because on the new version or the new layout, the deactivated or not the deactivated are not showing up here like on the old one, because I'm going to separate it and do like a separate page just for deactivated. So it doesn't cloud this up. Or I could probably add it as part of the filters here and just put all employees and then deactivated employees or something like that. So you want to see it here. So that's why. But on the other one, we were able to see deactivated employees on the same. So if I deactivated. And I'll. I'll take it back off. But I. If I deactivated. Kind of don't want to deactivate someone because it's going to show the record in the back end. But when I deactivated someone here, it still shows. It just have like a. A gray. Like a gray. What. What was it? It's like a gray highlighted looking. Yeah, but it still shows. But yeah, so that's. That's what it was. Okay, what was the second thing? The other thing that I had, like I said, in my Manage Access page, I'm specifically trying to change the department that a CFT is in. His name is Asael Gomez. And so when I found his profile, when I clicked Edit, he's just not Guest relations. And if I were to select a department, like, there's no save button on this One. There'S no say. Wow. Okay. I'll take these dogs over. Catastrophic ones. Oh my God. That's funny. There's no save button on the edit page. Okay. All right. Was that, was that the only two things? Yes. Okay. I think any other discussion will probably be all data related. So these are just these little things that the trainers are bringing to me. So. Okay, so far everything is working. As you can see, they're using it. The data's in there, which is good. Pushing for more observations with the trainers and everything. So. Okay. Yeah, no complaints on my end so far. All right, perfect. I did not do my job at all on Wednesday. Oh, unless they did. No. Do you guys want to go through that now? I'm, I'm doing it. I'm starting to look at it on the side right now. Yeah. Okay. I, I didn't know if you wanted to wait because you didn't understand the email or. No, I just didn't. I just didn't do my thought. Okay. Yeah, no, you're right. I was actually. Yeah, I was waiting on the. Yeah, what you said. Okay, so it's good to go. So I can do it now, but I was, I was waiting. Okay. Of course. All right. I mean we could go through them together really quick if you want. I mean it may take the rest of the call. No, I mean, I can do them. I, I was thinking about what we might need to show on Wednesday. So we need to show copies of the observations. We'll need to show like maybe the 3000 1690s. So the observations on 36 90s are good. So is there any dashboard that you're comfortable kind of showing yet to the gms? I mean we could show them pretty much everything here. I think the, the, this, the 369 dashboard is fine. Yes. I still may need to go back through and make some changes like these. I haven't done these yet, but I'll have that ready by, by Wednesday. I think this dashboard is fine because I don't think any gym is going to look at the numbers and be like, oh, that's incorrect. Right. Just the idea behind the dashboard. So I think this is fine to show them. Which ones are changing and not the performance is changing. 3060 dashboard. Yeah. Oh, hold on. Round one. I should put those menus over there too. So onboarding satisfaction. We're going to keep the percentage here. The last time we discussed, these are going to change to 10 same. So we're not editing any of the 30, 60, 91. So the actual, the actual onboarding satisfaction is 3.8 out of 10. No, because remember the. This measurement first was 1 to 5. I believe we had changed three questions. We change. I don't remember the specific question, but I remember was question 8, 9 and then on the 90 day we change question 6 also. 6, 8, 9 and 10. I believe so, yeah. So just like the observation where we have to go back in and make those five, ten, those threes five or however we want to do it, we may have to do the same thing. Also one of the questions I think is the confidence. It was more on a. I don't think it was on a number scale. It was maybe in the back end I was, I was. It was saving as number but it was. Or the feedback. I think it was the feedback. It was positive, negative, whatever. And we also change it too. So now it's looking for a number and it's not looking for that word. I think it was the feedback. So we got to find that one. And I believe it was this one, if I'm not mistaken. Or are this one. I gotta look at it again. Or maybe this one is the same. Because we're going to change the performance observations. But we weren't. We didn't have a plan to change the 30, 60 90s. No, no, we did not. So but I think most of these will stay the same. Hold on. So the question that we changed. Let me just actually go back to them real quick so I could understand. So for the 30 and 60, we change confident retention. No, we did 10 too. Right. Our 10 was already like that. So. So that's perfect. So now we just got to go back sa and see what the old database had. And I could probably do those too. But we just got to go back in now and see what the old database had because a 10 would be a 5, a 3 would be not. Yeah, a 5 would be a 10, a 3 would be a 5. Right. So if we look at the back end for some of these 36 to 90, then it's going to have scoring from 1 to 5 when it should be from 1 to 10. So we got to make those changes. So the dashboard is going to show. Is always going to show. Why do I keep going to observation? The dashboard is always going to show out of five. So like the performance is one, the confidence is one and the retention. Right. Because these were initially one to five. So it's doing it out of five, it needs to do it out of ten and this is probably up to eight because we probably have had some new scores. Our new survey with. With the one to ten scale. So it's. It's the numbers up there a little bit more. But we still need to go in and make some changes to the old ones. And I can bet if I look at. If I look at the database, it's probably saying the same thing. So if I go to the 369 database, so I could just look at the date. But yeah, so you're gonna have 5 and 10. So all these looks like they're new. Everything in August. And then. Hold on. Oh, so we only have 13. Okay. I also can't get to the completed surveys to edit them. I can't figure out how to get to those. I don't think. I don't perform the observations or the 30, 16, 90. I don't think I had an edit option for the 36 to 90. Did I create. I don't remember if I created one. I know I created an edit option for the observation. Where can I go to the old observations to edit them? Not the old one. Well, so if you go to. If you go to observation here and you open, say like this person. If you open it right, and you scroll to the bottom, there's an edit option here. Okay, got it. No problem. But read the email so you understand, because the one that says not measurable is really observed, unless on the. In the database, it's not measurable. If that makes sense. A little confusing. Oh, okay. Damn. Yeah. Oh, sorry, I was unmuted. I got to the next time. Like, hopefully we don't have to make any more, like, changes like that. But the next time I probably need to, like, download the database, export it to Excel, have it before I go in and do these changes. Just the email. I think you were at it. I don't know why the search name is not coming up. That's weird. Let me close this for a little bit and reopen it. I don't know why my email is acting like this. You're in the old outlook. I never switch. But it never used to act like this because I have so much crap open. You prefer the new one? Okay. This is it right here. Yeah. All right. So you guys got this email, right? Yeah. Okay, so basically, if it's. If it's not measurable, which is going to be 10, you're going to change not measurable to observe. Unless it's marked as NM in the data set, which is the sheet right here. See? Attach. Then keep it as not measurable, and I'll show you what that means in a sec. If it says not observe, we're going to keep it as not observed. If it says observe, we're going to change it to not observe. All right, so let's go through. Let's go through the first one. So I could kind of show you guys what I'm. What I mean. So this Excel sheet is the old database before we Change everyone from 1, 2, 3, NM to observe, not observe, which in the back end is really 10, 0, and NM following? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, sure. Okay. All right. I mean, I understand the changes. I'm just spending more time relating it to the actual observation. All right, so let's. Let's. Let's go through that. So if. So this is the new. This is what we want it to be. Right? So this is going to be. Or what is it what it is now? So this is the new version. So if it's a 10, then it's observe. If it's a 0, then it's not observe. So this is Yegord right now. Or is Yegord. Is Yegord real? Yeah, so let's. Let's do that one together. So I'm gonna. I'm gonna walk through that one with you so you could understand what I'm saying. So it's the one that I have highlighted in. In y. These. Right? So this is. This is the new. This is how we have it now. So this is the old one. So three would be 10, right? Observe. The first one for eboard. So this would be zero. One would also be zero. So these would be not observed. This would be the same. And then this would be N M. Does that make sense? Needs to be observed. Unless it's nm in the sheet. Correct. So, dang, what did she measure from this person? So, but do you guys understand this so far? Make sense? Yeah. You're gonna go into eboards. Yes. Yeah. All right, so I'm gonna put them side by side. And then. So this is. Come on. Okay, so let's start from the top. So why God? All right, so we're looking at this observation. So let's start with general question number one. Right? So general question number one for why God? Ibor Igor. Got a three, right? So they got a three. So a three back then is converted to a ten. Observe. So this should be. So let's edit real quick. So the first four should be observed. Are you changing it or you want me to change it? Okay, so the first four should be observed, right? So 1, 2, 3, 4, and then the next three should be not observed because 2, we're doing zero also like it. We didn't have a. We didn't have a description. It was just 2, 1, 2, or 3 and then NM. We didn't have, like, a description to it. Like observe, not observe. Should it be something on the center? Like, would it lower the scores overall if you made that zero, too? Oh, yeah. You have to have this be a 0, 1 or a 2, right? Huh. So what we're saying. So a 2 in the old system was like, we kind of saw it, but it needs work. But in the new system, we either observed it or we didn't. Correct. So what do we want group that score to be? Does that go to zero or does that go to observed? Because there is no longer like, oh, it needs work. Right. What do you want to put that under? Do you want to put it under observe or. Or not observe? How many entries do you have so far that would be changed by this? Every single observation. Observation that was done before. It's the ones in front of you, Ray? Yeah. Yeah. Pretty much everything that was done before August, all the observations. So there's only like, what, a dozen in here? Yeah, probably. Yeah. Okay, so it doesn't sound like a change in these scores would be that big of a variable to consider. No, I would say we leave it at zero. What are y' all thinking? I agree with that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So not observed in will not move. Is that correct, Omar? Yeah. So we'll leave these as not. So. Yeah, and that's kind of what I put. Not observe. Will just stay not observe. So that's what you put in your email. I agree with. Yeah. 1, 2, 3, 4, which is this 1, 2, 3, 4. And then we have 1, 2, 3 that are twos, which is 1, 2, 3. And then if you realize also. So we have the 1, 2, 3, which is twos, but this one, which is general question number we do. So it needs to be observe because it's a three, and then the first. So now we're in the SA role. The first role, roll one, is showing three, but it's showing NM here. So that's why I meant by if it's showing NM, just check to make sure it's not actual NM. But if it's a 3, then you move it to observe. Little confusing. And then the second role question is also a three. So it's going to be observe. And then there is a not observe, which is number three, but it's shown as an nm. Oh, that's kind of off. And then number. Hold on, I got confused. Let's go back up. So three. So that's correct. No, this should. So hold on. Now let's see what you guys waited for me. Okay, so three, two, two, three. So roll. So this is three. Two should be not observed. And then roll three. This should be observed. So this is what it looks like. Yeah, but because these are all two back in the days like so unless you want to switch these sa to observe. But yeah, because this would have. These would. Most of these would have been two which would have helped the score because right now this score is 4.7. Being that. Right. Faith, I know I lost you guys like five minutes ago, but that really makes me think now it's just back up, man. Oh, what are we thinking? Can we go to the top really quick? One more? Yeah. So the all of the not observed because in this instance Mia really didn't get to see a lot. No, I guess that's fair. Okay, so scored a 2.5 on their role specific observation out of 10. So this is going to highlight a lot I think in the, in the properties. But this person was being observed. But remember this is based on a three or four scale scoring where back then we were also looking for somewhat incompliant. Right. Oh maybe they have everything on. But I don't know. Well I don't know what they were looking at at that time. But the two would suggest that they are incompliant 90. But something is missing. That's why they got a two. Yeah. So exactly. Right. So like what Omar is saying and one placement really like where we would want to like if the training specialist sees that that's like horrific checking. Right. And I don't know, you know, I know we're going back and forth on like how we measure and how we put non measurable or not, you know, so maybe it doesn't show as bad but like that's one where you step in, you walk into the back and you're like Jeff, you won't believe what I just saw. Like you need to take care of this right away. So I don't know. You know, that's just kind of what I'm what I was thinking there with this. So I don't know because I mean. This two could mean because again these were two. So it's not like they just. Maybe in this one they, they confirmed the room type but they didn't confirm the rate. What's the comment on this? Because I wonder if this Came up when Danny had mentioned that all of our observations right now are check in specific. And if this wasn't like granted I wouldn't have had her fill this out if it wasn't an actual check in. But I wonder if it was disclosed. Anywhere in the comment. But she, but if that happens, Faith, we just put not measurable because then the scoring will ignore that. It won't count that against them. So again this one might have been just in the early days where we're learning how to fill out still. But as we get further in, right. Like you know, if you, if there's no chance to even score this, it's not fair. Right. We put not measurable here. Right. Omer, this is calculating, this is ignoring not measurable for the calculations at the top, right? Yeah, yeah it is, it is. So it's. This is scoring out of 19 rather than out of 22 because three were not measurable. Yes. I have to offer my four o'. Clock. So I would say think about this. I mean you guys let me know, I could probably work on most of them. You want to keep it like this. Just train the training specialist on any. Any further that we want to. We want to look at. Yeah, it's not going to help us nor you Omar, as a compliance of this. Right, so. Yeah, I agree. I'll take care of these though if you, if you consider taking care of the 3060 90s, I'll take care of these. Okay, I understand now. And I wrote down some extra notes for myself so I'll get these changed today. Okay. There, there. So but based on what I did here, like it's. It should be self explanatory. I mean all the threes will be observed because the threes would equate to 10 in how we're doing it now. Twos and ones would be zero and NM would be NM. There are about three. Three team members or three observation that that is missing. I. I got to look for the database, the backup database that have those three. But other than that everyone else is there in that Excel sheet. Can you, can you. I gotta drop 4 o'. Clock. Can you do 3 to 4 tomorrow for me and you, Omar? Yes. Yeah, I should be on to number three to four. Let's see. All right, Ray, Faith, you don't have to go to this one that you're about to get the email for. Actually hold on. Can we do four? Actually I could do three to four. I could move this to four. I have a one on one in Cocoa beach, but yeah. Yeah. Let's do three to four. Yeah. All right. Yeah. All right. All right. So. Right, you're about to get this. But you don't need to be at this meeting. This is just me. No more talking about the presentation on Wednesday. Okay. All right, bye. All right. Good to be sure. Thank you. Cool. Was there anything else that you guys had? It's sa. It's. Good, man. How are you? It's. It's sa. Hello? Hi. Hi. Are you busy? No, I can. I can listen. What's up? No, I can listen. I'm just typing or finish finishing up a code. About Jul. I've been annoyed all day. And then she. Me too. You what? Did you read Julie's email? No, I haven't checked my email in a little bit. She said there's an update coming for September. As of now, it looks like the 10th. It could slide back to the 24th depending on the rest of development testing. Our next scheduled call. Our next social meeting is the fifth. And I'm sure that won't be enough time to get info put together. Would you like me to look at time this week for us to touch back on the new feature? Yeah. What if it's the same feature that. Do you know that? That's what it is. I mean, that's what she told me. It was just a receipt printed. I mean, it's just where to go to print the receipt. But I. We didn't get into details. I don't think she know those details when I spoke to her a few weeks ago. So I guess it's not that big of a deal. But. Yeah, well, I mean, if you want to set up something. If you want to set up something, I mean, we could. I mean, do you just want to ask her? Do you want to respond to the email and say, all right, thank you, sir? Yeah, when I. Yeah, I'll probably write to it later or once I finish this. But yeah, I could just say I. I believe based on what we discussed, this is not. This doesn't require like major training or something because it's just print. Just a print receipt. The receipt feature being added or something like that. Yeah. So I can reply. You say, I. I believe this one should be fairly easy and doesn't require a. Like an actual whatever since it's just the receipt being added is just how to print the receipt. But I. You guys don't work. You don't. You don't work on their training manual. Right. Because I believe Kathleen has all those information already or all those screenshot well. That'S part of the problem with Johanna and sa. I mean, I want to say. No. Okay. As part of the problem with Johanna. And that's something I tried to very tactfully bring up to her on our call last week without saying, like, this before, but I was like, you guys have stuff in way too many places. I think your bigger problem, like, wow is is that if I need to find something, I can go to two different places to find it, and all 10 of those places may not be updated. I was like, you want to think about the last email you sent? You put in all these locations. Like, you shouldn't be updating things in all those locations. Like, if you have a wow. SharePoint, like, why do you also think you need the documentation? Like, that separate documentation of a book? Like, that's time license. I just don't really understand. Then we have a training, and then our training, like, update. Just the amount of money being spent to, like, keep materials updated for a while, in my opinion, is a little crazy. And it should all live in one place. But no, that's why we wouldn't create a manual for them. This was a whole thing when Victor was here. Because again, it did not. It didn't make sense. Right? Like, hold on. Sorry. I'm getting, like, three different texts based on the thing that I'm working on. Huh. I was just gonna answer them now. Like, I have. I have, like, four emails. Two of them that. Because the way I'm going to reply to it, I'm like, hey, I believe LND has Kathleen from LND has all these screenshots already if you want to reach out to her. Okay. Yeah. Tell me what the email says. You'Ll be. You want me call you on teams? Yeah. All right, let me do that. Okay. It. Hello? Okay. Oh, that was loud. I'm sorry. I was laughing at my team. Sorry. They're, like, yelling across the hall. Right before I. All right, so this one I need Diane. That I could do later. So this one from Julie. So they sent an email, and of course, you know, she include everyone. Diana, Sheena. I'm currently reviewing the World Loyalty Training Guide and notice that we still have images from Mr. Sums. We need new screenshots from FriendX console to update the guide. Is there a way to. To access FDC for these images? Please let me know. If not, could you or your team assist with the attached document? And then she's like, omar, is this something you want to handle or something you need my team to handle? So it was originally from Joanna. So let me see the attached document. It. I think Valeria has.","📅 **Meeting Overview**: The meeting focused on resolving technical issues related to employee data management and preparation for upcoming presentations.

🎯 **Key Decisions Made**:
- Agreed on how to handle observed vs. not observed data from previous employee evaluations.
- Decided to present the existing 369 dashboard to GMs, ensuring clarity in data representation.

📋 **Action Items**:
1. **Omar**: To address and resolve the edit and save issues on the Manage Access page by [Date].
2. **Team**: Update the employee observation data according to new criteria, converting old scores accordingly by [Date].
3. **Omar & Ray**: Meet from 3-4 PM tomorrow for further discussion on Wednesday’s presentation.
4. **Faith**: Edit current observation data as per the latest framework by end of day.
5. **General Task**: Update training materials and ensure all documented information is consistent across platforms.

💡 **Important Discussions**:
- Discussed confusion and technicalities of reactivating a deactivated employee (Mackenzie/Kenzie) in the system.
- Elaborated on the need for a user-friendly system to efficiently handle deactivated employees’ data.
- Considered improving the scoring system on observations from a ‘1-3 scale’ to fit a binary observed/unobserved format.
- Discussed the necessity of updating current dashboards and data systems to reflect accurate 30, 60, 90-day employee reviews.

⚠️ **Risks & Issues**:
- Difficulty in editing and saving changes on the Manage Access page; potential blockage in user access management.
- Inconsistencies in data sets between old and new observation systems may confuse reporting.

Does that make sense? Like so in talent acquisition, you're not supposed to do that. Every wreck should be a new wreck so that you have historical data on those, but it's not. Golf cart attendant is one wreck and everyone is hired into that one wreck. I see, I see. So it's always the wreck always gonna be. Yeah, right. You see what I'm saying? Yeah. But it shouldn't be like that. You should be able to see that. I had five golf cart attendant wrecks and this is the history of all of those wrecks. That's really how it should work. And Trisha's been trying to get that changed for a while, but I don't think our systems would allow us to do that or something. And so that's what's happening is that when they're asking them to open that position, if it's somebody, it's up here, it's up here. Vi says all of their information is up here. They don't write anything down. Oh. But that really speaks to some of the things that Westgate. That's the problem in TA is that because they turn over those team, those recruiters so often, somebody just wouldn't know and they would just back for the wreck. That's what's happening. So Trish is going to have to figure out a way to get that. Like. Yeah, I don't know what she's going to be able to do there, but. Okay. Okay. So. So we're good with those three checklists I'm sending them. I was just going through them in the, in the LMS to make sure that they were built properly. And so we're good with those three titles. So Guest Relations, Guest Experience and Resort Services Operator. Hold on, what was the second one? Guess. Guest gem. Oh, Jim. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes. Okay. Golf cart and Bell Staff. We're gonna leave it how it is for now. As in. As in we're not turning them on. We'Re not putting them, we're not separating them. Okay. Oh, we're not separating. Right. We're gonna leave it how it is. Bell services for now. There's. There's equally the same pros and cons with separating them and keeping them together. Spoke to pretty much everyone again from the gyms that would be affected, the department leaders that would be affected, hr. And. I mean the pros and cons, we're looking at more of a elevated department. Right. And if we bring in team members that are more guest facing, then it will elevate the department a little bit more. However, the plan, if we keep it. So we're just going to keep it would be. And that's one of the conversation I had with HR this morning. How does. How do we promote this position? Right. Because it's a. It's like a multi job position. How do we promote it? And then when we hire someone for the field and that would be up to me. How do we. How do we decide who goes where? Right. So what we've came up with was that when we hire someone, the position is going to be post as best services and then it's going to say like golf cart duties and then bell services, bell staff or something like that. Right. And the description will be for golf cart. So that's kind of what we discussed this morning. And so we still want to hire them to do that specific area, whether it's golf cart or bell staff. However, their training is going to be everything together right now. If they're in bell staff because that's what they're hired for and they. And we need help in golf cart, then they'll go to. Then they'll help. Right. So that's. That's kind of how we're approaching it. Okay. So is the thought that we want to then combine the two checklists into one. Yes. And figure out where there's overlap and do we want to do this now? So it's just sitting there ready, waiting to go or are we going to wait until we see the na actually hit and they. And then discuss how. How that impacts the checklist? Because this is the one where we can really use. Yes, this is the one we could. Really use any on this one. So did we. Did we tell you that it got moved from 2026 to scoops instead of. It's gonna be in Q4 of 2025. Things just told. Could be December, could be November. Yeah. Should we hold off? Because right now I rewrote it as if there was no N A. So I pulled out anything that was specific to golf cart because of the. The properties that don't have golf carts. Yeah, but how would the properties with golf cart operate? Because it's general enough that says. So that was that. Was that because they're very. The properties with golf cart. The golf cart trainings are very specific. So all I changed was I pulled out the two lines about golf cart training that were on day two. And it just says complete any additional CP training, practical exams and practice as required by your property. Okay. So that it just doesn't so it would. You'd have to keep with whatever record keeping you currently for the practical exam you wouldn't be able to use the lms. What about further down on that checklist where it goes over? There's two different other items. The Learn golf cart inspection, cleaning and maintenance. Learn out of service golf cart ticket. Those are all actually hot sauce items. When I spoke to Shane, he said that all those items except for like the, the cleaning and maintenance part, but the tickets, the sign out procedure, the check in procedure, all that are hot sauce items. So I was shoving them under there. Not completely. Okay, so the lakes for. For inspection and all those. Yes. For, for the lakes they use a different program to sign out. They have like a golf cart program that they use to sign out. But for the inspection and all that everyone use between the villas and the lakes they do use hot sauce. But for signing and signing out golf card, they use a different program at the lakes. Okay. And I think we had put like other. Our programs or something like that there. I don't remember. Any golf cart. I had shoved them all under hot sauce so that I can, I can pull them back out. And then. So then do we want to reinstate everything as it. As it was before and then just wait for the N.A. put any golf cart items that were on the golf cart attendant checklist that weren't already on bell services. I just, I feel like once we get the NA you may have to go back in. Right. That's why I'm like. And just kind of readjust. Four months. They didn't say. The problem is, is that they didn't say when in Q4. So I mean we're a month from Q4. Right. But. Right, Ari? Yeah. Yeah, pretty much. I mean who's Ryan Gaines? I have no idea. Westgate person. Yeah, he's. Email me me about Tablo Access. I don't. Table access. Rental revenue from Westgate. Grand Central from New York. Ryan Gaines. Oh, I know. Yes. At this rate, are we getting that Checklist out on 91? No. No. So at this rate, I don't mind. There's a possibility with the 10 one. I don't know if that's even on a work day, but the 101 release. We could ask Belinda on our next call. Like where is this at in Q4? I would just wait to be honest because you're. I don't want to, but that's just going to be double world. Okay, so let's go over it again. Once we know the NA Is. Yeah. Are just Created now with NA in mind. So once we get the na, you don't have to worry about, like, recreating anything and combining it. Hopefully. Hopefully. And combining it will kind of make it easier for you too. I mean, it's kind of one checklist. I like that, Dex, in the computer screen. I don't know who drew that. That's pretty cool. Okay, so I'll leave that. I'll just put a tickler thing in the file to revisit the checklists on 10.1 and find out where we are with the NA feature and how the jobs have all spun out. And can we all agree on. Yeah, that belongs to the checklist. Yeah. All right, so I think that's it about checklists. Okay. The only thing we were just. I was just mentioning to Adam is that it looks like all the job change profiles also include the Resort Ops Day 1 checklist. And they should not. Right. Say that again. The profiles that we use to assign courses for job change, because we have to assign them to new hires one way and job changes to the other. The job change ones include the Resort Ops Day 1 checklist. Now, if you're changing jobs, should you have done everything that's in that Resort Ops day one already and that you don't need that checklist again? So you're going from corporate to resort op. Okay, so then there's going to be overlap there, though, because in the corporate security and the one. The day one for corporate that Chris and I did like that I started. And security, it's basically the same thing. If you have adp stuff like that, like the majority of it's the same. Yeah. Like instead of meeting gm, it's like meeting your department leadership. Instead of property tour, it's like building. Tour, stuff like that. Throwing it out there because they would need those things. But. Nothing can ever. I mean, we could go back all of those. Well, it's a whole. It's a whole separate course that they have to do. So I feel like you would want to just remove it if you're not. If there's anything to sign it if you're transferring. Like, if I'm a resort, let's say I'm on Omar's team, but then I go to like housekeeping. Is there a way to. It's only going to understand that the. That tiling is going to not stuff that they're coming from. Yeah. So if you're going from resort to. Resort, it's a duplicate. I would just say leave it off. Okay. So that. That's a change that has to be then made to all the existing profiles. So do you want to change it? What do you mean? So if I go in already, I probably shouldn't have brought this up. Today feels like a Friday and it's only Tuesday so probably not. So if I look at job teams. So here's characters and if I go over here because this is such a stupid thing. Sorry. So I'm changing jobs. I do the welcome to Resort Ops and the animated character performance checklist. So do we still want them to do welcome to Resort Operations? It's built into every job change profile. So KP would have to go in and delete them all. Can you just turn them off? She can, she can delete. She'd have to delete out that class. She can't turn it. She would want us to leave it running. But she'd just have to delete that class. It's not a big deal to delete the one class but I just didn't want to. I just noticed it today when I was, when I was fixing the ones when I was sending her the information for Omar and I was like ah crap. Can we just ask, can we bringing this back up and bring it up with Alex. Okay. I just don't want to make decisions about reserve ops without him. Okay. Moving on. Quick hit things. The well loyalty screenshots. All good. Did you want. All good. Okay. So you're good. You're going to send them to Joanna? Already did. Spoke to her this morning. Who pays what is is still uncharged to go out. So I think you wanted to launch it the 28th. Yes. So the reason for that is I have my meeting on the 20th, my front office national meeting on the 29th. Okay. So I just want to show it to them real quick and show it to them there at the meeting. Okay. Yeah, we did. We did decide to trial a survey on the end of it. So there will be one extra thing. So it's going to be the elearning the chart and then just a five question survey and it's just a tiny experiment and then we'll figure out strategy going forward for how we would want to if we want to scale it. Okay. So that's that. Yeah. I realized I did not have a clue what you guys were talking about the other day. That's right. I did kind of grab you as you were walking down the hall. I was really mad at that point too. I did talk to Alex a bit. Got his perspective. His is a little different. We talked a little Bit about it. Okay, so we'll make sense. Scale it off every time water park at some ridiculous hour of the morning. I sent you to water park. I saw that. I'm look at the head but I'm. Like these are going out yesterday bled into today. But what do you call. So I don't know if you want to go over those or if there was other stuff that. That that's all that I had because needs to get out the door. So. So, so I can move on to the other stuff if you wanted to go over those or if you wanted. If there was other stuff that you had on your agenda. No, I think that was it. Did Julie respond and say that that's what the meeting is about? Oh, I was going to say that Friday at 2:00'. Clock. Yeah. What was she thinking? Wait, she said that meeting at 2 o'? Clock? Yes. I didn't see that I was Friday. Of a holiday weekend. What was, what was the reply from her though? Did she say I don't think any. Of them are on the email because. When I originally Elite. Hold on. Responded to her took everybody off. Am I yes to this or not? Oh she just said sounds good, I'll get something on the calendar. So she didn't really answer if it's the. I'm gonna go into the holiday weekend. Pissed off. If it's the release. But if it's the receipt, I'm sure it's a receipt release. And okay. Honestly I don't think you need to put anything together for that. Okay. Okay. Okay cool. It's. And if you do it's something really simple. Okay. Where to go, where to click print. Okay. I saw the one for. I figured out where the one was for for folios. So when I saw. It's just because kind of you hit the little three dots and yeah you hit receipt. And I mean if it's, if it's. It's for the 50 hold or the hold whole. I'm assuming it would be somewhere under the whole section. Right. I mean that would probably be the best place to put it. So I don't, I don't see a lot of training needed for that. Okay. It seems like it's just an email and it's just gonna hound yeah you or me until something so she has proof that they were. I'll just send out normally send out that email. They were informed. So that was the only other thing that I had. And then yeah it's just water park. So I did. Did front desk agent and I did Front desk managers first. The front desk managers would take the front desk agent course and the front end. The front desk manager course. The front desk manager will take the frontex agent course for. For water park. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. And then water park team members would just take their own except for Smoky Mountain, who would have them take front desk agent and water park team members since they're going to be the ones issuing the. Yes. And I do think it's not necessary, but I do think the water park should take the water park even though they're not going to be doing anything. Oh, the Smoky Water. The Smoky's water park. Because eventually. Okay, we may get them their own tablets and have them. Actually, they. I think they still need to take it as. Because if someone comes and say, hey, I didn't get, you know, fans or whatever, rather than coming back to the front decks, I would like for them to look it up right there rather than sending them back to the front decks. Okay. So you're going to equip them to be able to do that. Okay. I need to check in with River Ranch and the lakes. Well, I need to check in with Michelle to see if the water park. If the lakes and River Ranch have got their access yet and their devices. That's kind of her job. And if the, the link you send, if it's the Cook reference guide that you had and you just kind of put it there. I mean, I'm sure it's. I'm sure it's good to go. I jazzed it up a little bit. I gave it. I gave it a quiz at the end. Okay. So, yeah, I mean, it's all the same material, so it should be. It should be good. I'm trying to think if there was anything. Is it interactive or just. I started them out. It's not super interactive. I mean, there's some tabs and things that they can click on. There's a drag and drop. Okay. Some flip cards. I try to start out most of the lessons with a question and try and let them puzzle it out on their own first or take a guess at least, as opposed to just here's all the information. Right. So, you know, kind of that. More of that discovery type mindset as opposed to what you call. And it's set up just like, just. It's in the same 360. It's kind of same idea as Megan's that you can make comments on, on the screens. So. Okay, cool. Anything. I'm gonna go through it because I was a little delirious here. So I know there's a typo or two that I couldn't find and I'm like, I don't care. They're going out anyway. That's right. So I'll just, I'll just go give it one more pass through and make sure. There was nothing that I was a little iffy on the wording okay. For that. And I know we never. You still haven't heard about the idea of that it doesn't matter if they're staying on their, their, their usage. So I was intentionally vague to kind of leave that. Yeah, yeah, I, yeah, I wouldn't get into that too much. They're just going to follow their current procedure and the current procedure right now if a owner that books outside of their week outside of their account, if they can prove that they're an owner, we're still giving them the benefit. So if they book through Expedia Hotels.com we're still giving them all the benefits. If they can show, hey, I'm an owner with their phone or whatever, their, some of them still have their old card, we still give them the owner's benefit. Okay. Now just thinking of this, I know right now we're really focused on existing team members but going forward, this will be something we can include in the whole new hire. We can add that whole onboarding thing the same way we're adding who pays. What is there going to be besides this? Are they going to get an introduction to water park policy in some other way or do we need to add any kind of policy information into this? We didn't add anything for the Frontex agent for water park. Right. This kind of came up after the checklist for water park. It says, it says it on. It just says the, like the day. It has like all the tabs. So I think the voucher tab is slash Water park is one of the checklist items. So it doesn't have any sub bullets. Or anything to explain it. No, but what you just said, Yes, I would love for it to be included, whatever, wherever it's going to be placed on the checklist. So when you get to it, that's going to be the lesson. Okay. Right. Yeah. And I think maybe that's the next step too is to start looking at some of these checklist items and turn them into E Learning. Okay. Yeah, absolutely. So, but, so is there anything I need to. So when you're, when you're going through the course, are there any policies and procedures related to water park that I need to add to the Course that would, that would benefit a new hire. So just to keep that in mind. You have to think about that. Let me ask Michelle too. I can't think of any, you know, most of the stuff that I'm thinking of, it's really specific to the water park, like entrance capacity in terms of how many people. Those are just stuff that the water park team members need to know for front decks. Not really, but I'll, I'll, I'll talk to her, Michelle, and see if there's anything. But I really can't think of anything really. And then in terms of assignments, should this also get assigned to resort services operators? The water park? Yes, because they may get a call that says, hey, and they, you know, the guest doesn't know who they're talking to. They dial zero. They think they're talking to the front desk when it's resort services. So they're like, hey, I checked in and can you check how many water park pass I have left or something? So at least they'll know how to check it in reserve services. So yeah. Okay. And they can't add anything. The water park? Yeah, they can't. They wouldn't be able to add. You're not giving them any positions to add entries. Any permissions. Who did I give access from that? I think the managers does have access. I think. Think so. Okay, so we should add then the managers also to take the manager class and the front desk agent class. From resource services. Yes. Okay. Yeah, I think it's the manager. Did I add the supervisors? I think it's just the managers. And then what about guest relations? Do they need any access or do. They need any water? Oh, they do. They definitely do. And the same thing is it's split between guest relations agent and manager. Yes. Because so in guest relations, I just added the access. Recently, every single guest relations team member has access at the villas to override. Okay. Why? Because whenever sales have a new owner, they go to guest relations to get them access to the water park. So they should. So guest relations, agents and UP should take the. Both the, the agent and the. Yes. I said K's gonna love me when I try to explain how we're gonna. I mean you could just assign everything to all of front decks. Well, I don't want them to use if they're not. If they don't have the power to do something to do override, tell them to do it. I see what you're saying. Yeah. Because FriendX agent. Except Smoli. Otherwise the only one. Yeah. Have access to override do. Okay, so then hold on one second. Let me just. Both agent and manager. Okay. And then Smokey Smoke Weeds said their water park people should also take the word for team member. Their front desk agents, they still have the same split between managers have to do the override things. Right. Okay. Okay. So they get. They get assigned same thing. They just also get the water park. Yeah. One to be able to do the issuing point. Correct part. Because it, it should be like the permission should be divided by role. Like it should be based on role. So whichever property should still be manager. I think supervisors are not. If I'm not mistaken. I don't remember. Okay. But yeah. Okay. And then I'll reach out to Michelle for the water park team member piece of it. Because I think their titles get all wonky depending on. Oh, it's, it's. Yeah. I mean they did the consolidation too, like when they were eliminating titles and stuff. And I think honestly, I don't know what they're called. I think they're all called guest experience agent. But it, it's a combination of lifeguards. Okay. And they all work different property do it different. Like the lakes, when I was on the call with them going over like what they need. They use all their lifeguards as cashiers. Okay. And lifeguards. And then they rotate them. And so I'm like, so who, who are cashiers? You're like, oh, everyone. Okay. So they all rotate them. So we may have a bigger group to train there because they. They rotate everyone. Okay. Okay. Now we also. We had talked about. So now you still want. We want to try and have everybody go through the E learning first before we deploy any in person training. Ideally last time we. Because then they don't do the. Then they don't do the elearning. Okay. So yeah, that would be ideal. Yeah. So does that work? So I know, I know our date was 9 8. Is that 98 for. For customer. For guests to start entering the water park and everybody be trained by. Or is that 9 8? We want to start training. 9 8. We want to start training. Okay, gotcha. And we'll just give ourselves a week. So. Okay. Which we may not need last time was like two days. So maybe they could start on Friday. And just by looking at. I just got a report right now from the analytics team that does tableau and every single property is actually using the water park feature already. What? Yeah, not well, all the properties that have water park. So. Okay, so for example, like let's see. Smokey issued 16 vouchers in the last week. We don't need no stinking training. Towers. Issued six fillers, issued 154, tungsten 180. Okay, so the feature is there. I mean, the feature is there, right? So I reach out to Kayla. I'm like, hey, are you using it? He's like, honestly, I kind of use it sometimes because it's just there and it's so easy. Okay, but I'm like, kayla, but what. But why would anybody on a non water park property be hitting the issue button? Because that means. That means somebody's handing them a wristband when they hit issue, correct? No, this is just a report showing how many were issued per property, not showing who issued it overall. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So. All right, well, the training should be really quick. At least they like it. Yeah, they're already using it. Do I need to talk to Faith then about having somebody at all these properties? And then if we're doing three properties simultaneously, how do we want. Do we want to prioritize? I know we have. Don't we have someone at. What's her name? Danny and Smokey? Can she do Smokey? I can talk to Fate and then. Just someone at Ranch. Okay, and who's responsible for which resorts? Hold on. Between Mia and. I'll get it wrong. I just know their big property. I never can remember their small properties. Hold on. Isn't that the Summit? The Summit is on the eight, right? Summit. It sure is. We can't do that. Where is it? Is it the Lakes? Is that the Villas? Damn. Should I cancel? I have a way out. I don't have to speak. I'm just kidding. Jared goes before me and then I go and then you. God damn it. It's always something giving you all the facts so you have them before you make a decision. Okay, fine. This is the last year for them. Every freaking year. Invite someone else. We just. We could take the two hours and do it together. It's me. Then you just combine the whole thing in two hours. I could. It's really from a training perspective, it's mainly for an office, so. Yeah. Would have to come up. We can come up with something. Yeah. All right. Sorry. That's okay. That just. The eight didn't put two and two together. It's the rollout day and the wow day. The wow Summit. Fun. Well, Bill, this is. It just. It will impact whoever is attending. I guess that wow. Yeah. Summit. Because I was gonna say I could just. I could be at the Lakes that day, but the summit, I mean, I could come over there after the summit but I know if Ray's doing it he likes to do the meetings early like he likes to do 9, 10 o'. Clock. But I guess it just depends on who. But we'll definitely need someone at River Ranch and someone at the lakes. Okay. And honestly the, the assistance that they need was really, it was more system related. Not the system messing up but user system assistance. Okay. Yeah. On the water park side or on. The, on the water park side. Okay. I can't log in. How do I like. Yeah, it was, it was mostly most of that that we dealt with. Okay. Yeah. There's definitely a module right at the beginning of the, of the training on how to like your sans account and all that. Yeah. So but they're still, you're still saying that kind of. I was surprised. I mean keeping people. I mean some of those team members, they, they're not that they're not around computers. Yeah. They have a cell phone but they've never linked. They've never had an account. Right. With Westgate. Right. They've never had to log into an email. They've never had to do any of that. I mean I've probably set up three accounts like as new account because they've never had an account, never had an email, nothing. Okay. So. So there, some of them is just going to be very new to logging into a Westgate computer. So that those were probably some of the assistance that they need. Okay. Do you still want to stick with 9899 is there. Is 98 a holiday? Like is 9 is no. 91. Okay. So yeah, I mean I'm good with. I don't know also what the team members schedules look like or anything like that. Let's do 99. That will probably help a little bit better because Morgan is normally off Monday, Tuesday. Sorry Sunday. Monday. So she'll be there on Tuesday. Okay. And I don't know if that's gonna change by then when they make all these changes. Yeah. So we'll do 99. And then for whoever's going to River Ranch is can they get everybody in one day? I have no idea the size of the team or when they're gonna have to spend multiple days going out to River Ranch. I think one day is fine. I met with the team, the front office team is very small and then I met with the water park team when I was out there. Okay. And it's not, it's not a big team. I think one day. I mean everybody else, the other ones are all local. Yeah. And I think we're given 99. I mean, yeah, we're giving them enough time if we send it out today. I'll send out an email to them today, which I think I. Let me talk to Faith first and just confirm that she's got that the trainers are available. Okay. And then I can let you know then. Yeah, but I'm not sending, like, trainers. Name just, like, the dates. Right. Okay. I. Well, I had told them 98 two weeks ago. Or I'll send it to Michelle and have Michelle send it out to them. But. Yeah, so we should be good there. Okay. All right. I think that's. I think that's all the questions that I have for Water park at the moment. Okay. So water park. Check this. What. What else was on the agenda for. Your career path thing? I know I said I would do the on demand suggestions for each thing. I added those in. I just need to hyperlink them. Like, review links to the. Okay. Yeah. So like, for Front desk, I did guest service fundamentals. I kind of kept it like 5 or less. I did guest service fundamentals. Handling difficult guest service scenarios and then. Resolving conflicts are good ones. For the advanced Front Desk, I did time management essentials. It does a guide to workplace integrity. Yes. For cft, Effective feedback strategies. A guide to mentoring others, and then a guide to legal. Perfect. And then Jen is. There's some of her left here because. I know you said they could either go into both or one or the other. Yeah. Business writing fundamentals, Project management fundamentals, and then effective feedback strategies. That's one that overlaps. Yeah. Supervisor 5 Leadership styles to influence a team. A leader's guide to resolving team conflict, Motivating your team. Performance management essentials, and then leading.","📅 **Meeting Overview**: The meeting focused on talent acquisition practices, checklist updates, and preparation for upcoming training and implementation timelines.

Does that make sense? Like so in talent acquisition, you're not supposed to do that. Every wreck should be a new wreck so that you have historical data on those, but it's not. Golf cart attendant is one wreck and everyone is hired into that one wreck. I see, I see. So it's always the wreck always gonna be. Yeah, right. You see what I'm saying? Yeah. But it shouldn't be like that. You should be able to see that. I had five golf cart attendant wrecks and this is the history of all of those wrecks. That's really how it should work. And Trisha's been trying to get that changed for a while, but I don't think our systems would allow us to do that or something. And so that's what's happening is that when they're asking them to open that position, if it's somebody, it's up here, it's up here. Vi says all of their information is up here. They don't write anything down. Oh. But that really speaks to some of the things that Westgate. That's the problem in TA is that because they turn over those team, those recruiters so often, somebody just wouldn't know and they would just back for the wreck. That's what's happening. So Trish is going to have to figure out a way to get that. Like. Yeah, I don't know what she's going to be able to do there, but. Okay. Okay. So. So we're good with those three checklists I'm sending them. I was just going through them in the, in the LMS to make sure that they were built properly. And so we're good with those three titles. So Guest Relations, Guest Experience and Resort Services Operator. Hold on, what was the second one? Guess. Guest gem. Oh, Jim. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes. Okay. Golf cart and Bell Staff. We're gonna leave it how it is for now. As in. As in we're not turning them on. We'Re not putting them, we're not separating them. Okay. Oh, we're not separating. Right. We're gonna leave it how it is. Bell services for now. There's. There's equally the same pros and cons with separating them and keeping them together. Spoke to pretty much everyone again from the gyms that would be affected, the department leaders that would be affected, hr. And. I mean the pros and cons, we're looking at more of a elevated department. Right. And if we bring in team members that are more guest facing, then it will elevate the department a little bit more. However, the plan, if we keep it. So we're just going to keep it would be. And that's one of the conversation I had with HR this morning. How does. How do we promote this position? Right. Because it's a. It's like a multi job position. How do we promote it? And then when we hire someone for the field and that would be up to me. How do we. How do we decide who goes where? Right. So what we've came up with was that when we hire someone, the position is going to be post as best services and then it's going to say like golf cart duties and then bell services, bell staff or something like that. Right. And the description will be for golf cart. So that's kind of what we discussed this morning. And so we still want to hire them to do that specific area, whether it's golf cart or bell staff. However, their training is going to be everything together right now. If they're in bell staff because that's what they're hired for and they. And we need help in golf cart, then they'll go to. Then they'll help. Right. So that's. That's kind of how we're approaching it. Okay. So is the thought that we want to then combine the two checklists into one. Yes. And figure out where there's overlap and do we want to do this now? So it's just sitting there ready, waiting to go or are we going to wait until we see the na actually hit and they. And then discuss how. How that impacts the checklist? Because this is the one where we can really use. Yes, this is the one we could. Really use any on this one. So did we. Did we tell you that it got moved from 2026 to scoops instead of. It's gonna be in Q4 of 2025. Things just told. Could be December, could be November. Yeah. Should we hold off? Because right now I rewrote it as if there was no N A. So I pulled out anything that was specific to golf cart because of the. The properties that don't have golf carts. Yeah, but how would the properties with golf cart operate? Because it's general enough that says. So that was that. Was that because they're very. The properties with golf cart. The golf cart trainings are very specific. So all I changed was I pulled out the two lines about golf cart training that were on day two. And it just says complete any additional CP training, practical exams and practice as required by your property. Okay. So that it just doesn't so it would. You'd have to keep with whatever record keeping you currently for the practical exam you wouldn't be able to use the lms. What about further down on that checklist where it goes over? There's two different other items. The Learn golf cart inspection, cleaning and maintenance. Learn out of service golf cart ticket. Those are all actually hot sauce items. When I spoke to Shane, he said that all those items except for like the, the cleaning and maintenance part, but the tickets, the sign out procedure, the check in procedure, all that are hot sauce items. So I was shoving them under there. Not completely. Okay, so the lakes for. For inspection and all those. Yes. For, for the lakes they use a different program to sign out. They have like a golf cart program that they use to sign out. But for the inspection and all that everyone use between the villas and the lakes they do use hot sauce. But for signing and signing out golf card, they use a different program at the lakes. Okay. And I think we had put like other. Our programs or something like that there. I don't remember. Any golf cart. I had shoved them all under hot sauce so that I can, I can pull them back out. And then. So then do we want to reinstate everything as it. As it was before and then just wait for the N.A. put any golf cart items that were on the golf cart attendant checklist that weren't already on bell services. I just, I feel like once we get the NA you may have to go back in. Right. That's why I'm like. And just kind of readjust. Four months. They didn't say. The problem is, is that they didn't say when in Q4. So I mean we're a month from Q4. Right. But. Right, Ari? Yeah. Yeah, pretty much. I mean who's Ryan Gaines? I have no idea. Westgate person. Yeah, he's. Email me me about Tablo Access. I don't. Table access. Rental revenue from Westgate. Grand Central from New York. Ryan Gaines. Oh, I know. Yes. At this rate, are we getting that Checklist out on 91? No. No. So at this rate, I don't mind. There's a possibility with the 10 one. I don't know if that's even on a work day, but the 101 release. We could ask Belinda on our next call. Like where is this at in Q4? I would just wait to be honest because you're. I don't want to, but that's just going to be double world. Okay, so let's go over it again. Once we know the NA Is. Yeah. Are just Created now with NA in mind. So once we get the na, you don't have to worry about, like, recreating anything and combining it. Hopefully. Hopefully. And combining it will kind of make it easier for you too. I mean, it's kind of one checklist. I like that, Dex, in the computer screen. I don't know who drew that. That's pretty cool. Okay, so I'll leave that. I'll just put a tickler thing in the file to revisit the checklists on 10.1 and find out where we are with the NA feature and how the jobs have all spun out. And can we all agree on. Yeah, that belongs to the checklist. Yeah. All right, so I think that's it about checklists. Okay. The only thing we were just. I was just mentioning to Adam is that it looks like all the job change profiles also include the Resort Ops Day 1 checklist. And they should not. Right. Say that again. The profiles that we use to assign courses for job change, because we have to assign them to new hires one way and job changes to the other. The job change ones include the Resort Ops Day 1 checklist. Now, if you're changing jobs, should you have done everything that's in that Resort Ops day one already and that you don't need that checklist again? So you're going from corporate to resort op. Okay, so then there's going to be overlap there, though, because in the corporate security and the one. The day one for corporate that Chris and I did like that I started. And security, it's basically the same thing. If you have adp stuff like that, like the majority of it's the same. Yeah. Like instead of meeting gm, it's like meeting your department leadership. Instead of property tour, it's like building. Tour, stuff like that. Throwing it out there because they would need those things. But. Nothing can ever. I mean, we could go back all of those. Well, it's a whole. It's a whole separate course that they have to do. So I feel like you would want to just remove it if you're not. If there's anything to sign it if you're transferring. Like, if I'm a resort, let's say I'm on Omar's team, but then I go to like housekeeping. Is there a way to. It's only going to understand that the. That tiling is going to not stuff that they're coming from. Yeah. So if you're going from resort to. Resort, it's a duplicate. I would just say leave it off. Okay. So that. That's a change that has to be then made to all the existing profiles. So do you want to change it? What do you mean? So if I go in already, I probably shouldn't have brought this up. Today feels like a Friday and it's only Tuesday so probably not. So if I look at job teams. So here's characters and if I go over here because this is such a stupid thing. Sorry. So I'm changing jobs. I do the welcome to Resort Ops and the animated character performance checklist. So do we still want them to do welcome to Resort Operations? It's built into every job change profile. So KP would have to go in and delete them all. Can you just turn them off? She can, she can delete. She'd have to delete out that class. She can't turn it. She would want us to leave it running. But she'd just have to delete that class. It's not a big deal to delete the one class but I just didn't want to. I just noticed it today when I was, when I was fixing the ones when I was sending her the information for Omar and I was like ah crap. Can we just ask, can we bringing this back up and bring it up with Alex. Okay. I just don't want to make decisions about reserve ops without him. Okay. Moving on. Quick hit things. The well loyalty screenshots. All good. Did you want. All good. Okay. So you're good. You're going to send them to Joanna? Already did. Spoke to her this morning. Who pays what is is still uncharged to go out. So I think you wanted to launch it the 28th. Yes. So the reason for that is I have my meeting on the 20th, my front office national meeting on the 29th. Okay. So I just want to show it to them real quick and show it to them there at the meeting. Okay. Yeah, we did. We did decide to trial a survey on the end of it. So there will be one extra thing. So it's going to be the elearning the chart and then just a five question survey and it's just a tiny experiment and then we'll figure out strategy going forward for how we would want to if we want to scale it. Okay. So that's that. Yeah. I realized I did not have a clue what you guys were talking about the other day. That's right. I did kind of grab you as you were walking down the hall. I was really mad at that point too. I did talk to Alex a bit. Got his perspective. His is a little different. We talked a little Bit about it. Okay, so we'll make sense. Scale it off every time water park at some ridiculous hour of the morning. I sent you to water park. I saw that. I'm look at the head but I'm. Like these are going out yesterday bled into today. But what do you call. So I don't know if you want to go over those or if there was other stuff that. That that's all that I had because needs to get out the door. So. So, so I can move on to the other stuff if you wanted to go over those or if you wanted. If there was other stuff that you had on your agenda. No, I think that was it. Did Julie respond and say that that's what the meeting is about? Oh, I was going to say that Friday at 2:00'. Clock. Yeah. What was she thinking? Wait, she said that meeting at 2 o'? Clock? Yes. I didn't see that I was Friday. Of a holiday weekend. What was, what was the reply from her though? Did she say I don't think any. Of them are on the email because. When I originally Elite. Hold on. Responded to her took everybody off. Am I yes to this or not? Oh she just said sounds good, I'll get something on the calendar. So she didn't really answer if it's the. I'm gonna go into the holiday weekend. Pissed off. If it's the release. But if it's the receipt, I'm sure it's a receipt release. And okay. Honestly I don't think you need to put anything together for that. Okay. Okay. Okay cool. It's. And if you do it's something really simple. Okay. Where to go, where to click print. Okay. I saw the one for. I figured out where the one was for for folios. So when I saw. It's just because kind of you hit the little three dots and yeah you hit receipt. And I mean if it's, if it's. It's for the 50 hold or the hold whole. I'm assuming it would be somewhere under the whole section. Right. I mean that would probably be the best place to put it. So I don't, I don't see a lot of training needed for that. Okay. It seems like it's just an email and it's just gonna hound yeah you or me until something so she has proof that they were. I'll just send out normally send out that email. They were informed. So that was the only other thing that I had. And then yeah it's just water park. So I did. Did front desk agent and I did Front desk managers first. The front desk managers would take the front desk agent course and the front end. The front desk manager course. The front desk manager will take the frontex agent course for. For water park. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. And then water park team members would just take their own except for Smoky Mountain, who would have them take front desk agent and water park team members since they're going to be the ones issuing the. Yes. And I do think it's not necessary, but I do think the water park should take the water park even though they're not going to be doing anything. Oh, the Smoky Water. The Smoky's water park. Because eventually. Okay, we may get them their own tablets and have them. Actually, they. I think they still need to take it as. Because if someone comes and say, hey, I didn't get, you know, fans or whatever, rather than coming back to the front decks, I would like for them to look it up right there rather than sending them back to the front decks. Okay. So you're going to equip them to be able to do that. Okay. I need to check in with River Ranch and the lakes. Well, I need to check in with Michelle to see if the water park. If the lakes and River Ranch have got their access yet and their devices. That's kind of her job. And if the, the link you send, if it's the Cook reference guide that you had and you just kind of put it there. I mean, I'm sure it's. I'm sure it's good to go. I jazzed it up a little bit. I gave it. I gave it a quiz at the end. Okay. So, yeah, I mean, it's all the same material, so it should be. It should be good. I'm trying to think if there was anything. Is it interactive or just. I started them out. It's not super interactive. I mean, there's some tabs and things that they can click on. There's a drag and drop. Okay. Some flip cards. I try to start out most of the lessons with a question and try and let them puzzle it out on their own first or take a guess at least, as opposed to just here's all the information. Right. So, you know, kind of that. More of that discovery type mindset as opposed to what you call. And it's set up just like, just. It's in the same 360. It's kind of same idea as Megan's that you can make comments on, on the screens. So. Okay, cool. Anything. I'm gonna go through it because I was a little delirious here. So I know there's a typo or two that I couldn't find and I'm like, I don't care. They're going out anyway. That's right. So I'll just, I'll just go give it one more pass through and make sure. There was nothing that I was a little iffy on the wording okay. For that. And I know we never. You still haven't heard about the idea of that it doesn't matter if they're staying on their, their, their usage. So I was intentionally vague to kind of leave that. Yeah, yeah, I, yeah, I wouldn't get into that too much. They're just going to follow their current procedure and the current procedure right now if a owner that books outside of their week outside of their account, if they can prove that they're an owner, we're still giving them the benefit. So if they book through Expedia Hotels.com we're still giving them all the benefits. If they can show, hey, I'm an owner with their phone or whatever, their, some of them still have their old card, we still give them the owner's benefit. Okay. Now just thinking of this, I know right now we're really focused on existing team members but going forward, this will be something we can include in the whole new hire. We can add that whole onboarding thing the same way we're adding who pays. What is there going to be besides this? Are they going to get an introduction to water park policy in some other way or do we need to add any kind of policy information into this? We didn't add anything for the Frontex agent for water park. Right. This kind of came up after the checklist for water park. It says, it says it on. It just says the, like the day. It has like all the tabs. So I think the voucher tab is slash Water park is one of the checklist items. So it doesn't have any sub bullets. Or anything to explain it. No, but what you just said, Yes, I would love for it to be included, whatever, wherever it's going to be placed on the checklist. So when you get to it, that's going to be the lesson. Okay. Right. Yeah. And I think maybe that's the next step too is to start looking at some of these checklist items and turn them into E Learning. Okay. Yeah, absolutely. So, but, so is there anything I need to. So when you're, when you're going through the course, are there any policies and procedures related to water park that I need to add to the Course that would, that would benefit a new hire. So just to keep that in mind. You have to think about that. Let me ask Michelle too. I can't think of any, you know, most of the stuff that I'm thinking of, it's really specific to the water park, like entrance capacity in terms of how many people. Those are just stuff that the water park team members need to know for front decks. Not really, but I'll, I'll, I'll talk to her, Michelle, and see if there's anything. But I really can't think of anything really. And then in terms of assignments, should this also get assigned to resort services operators? The water park? Yes, because they may get a call that says, hey, and they, you know, the guest doesn't know who they're talking to. They dial zero. They think they're talking to the front desk when it's resort services. So they're like, hey, I checked in and can you check how many water park pass I have left or something? So at least they'll know how to check it in reserve services. So yeah. Okay. And they can't add anything. The water park? Yeah, they can't. They wouldn't be able to add. You're not giving them any positions to add entries. Any permissions. Who did I give access from that? I think the managers does have access. I think. Think so. Okay, so we should add then the managers also to take the manager class and the front desk agent class. From resource services. Yes. Okay. Yeah, I think it's the manager. Did I add the supervisors? I think it's just the managers. And then what about guest relations? Do they need any access or do. They need any water? Oh, they do. They definitely do. And the same thing is it's split between guest relations agent and manager. Yes. Because so in guest relations, I just added the access. Recently, every single guest relations team member has access at the villas to override. Okay. Why? Because whenever sales have a new owner, they go to guest relations to get them access to the water park. So they should. So guest relations, agents and UP should take the. Both the, the agent and the. Yes. I said K's gonna love me when I try to explain how we're gonna. I mean you could just assign everything to all of front decks. Well, I don't want them to use if they're not. If they don't have the power to do something to do override, tell them to do it. I see what you're saying. Yeah. Because FriendX agent. Except Smoli. Otherwise the only one. Yeah. Have access to override do. Okay, so then hold on one second. Let me just. Both agent and manager. Okay. And then Smokey Smoke Weeds said their water park people should also take the word for team member. Their front desk agents, they still have the same split between managers have to do the override things. Right. Okay. Okay. So they get. They get assigned same thing. They just also get the water park. Yeah. One to be able to do the issuing point. Correct part. Because it, it should be like the permission should be divided by role. Like it should be based on role. So whichever property should still be manager. I think supervisors are not. If I'm not mistaken. I don't remember. Okay. But yeah. Okay. And then I'll reach out to Michelle for the water park team member piece of it. Because I think their titles get all wonky depending on. Oh, it's, it's. Yeah. I mean they did the consolidation too, like when they were eliminating titles and stuff. And I think honestly, I don't know what they're called. I think they're all called guest experience agent. But it, it's a combination of lifeguards. Okay. And they all work different property do it different. Like the lakes, when I was on the call with them going over like what they need. They use all their lifeguards as cashiers. Okay. And lifeguards. And then they rotate them. And so I'm like, so who, who are cashiers? You're like, oh, everyone. Okay. So they all rotate them. So we may have a bigger group to train there because they. They rotate everyone. Okay. Okay. Now we also. We had talked about. So now you still want. We want to try and have everybody go through the E learning first before we deploy any in person training. Ideally last time we. Because then they don't do the. Then they don't do the elearning. Okay. So yeah, that would be ideal. Yeah. So does that work? So I know, I know our date was 9 8. Is that 98 for. For customer. For guests to start entering the water park and everybody be trained by. Or is that 9 8? We want to start training. 9 8. We want to start training. Okay, gotcha. And we'll just give ourselves a week. So. Okay. Which we may not need last time was like two days. So maybe they could start on Friday. And just by looking at. I just got a report right now from the analytics team that does tableau and every single property is actually using the water park feature already. What? Yeah, not well, all the properties that have water park. So. Okay, so for example, like let's see. Smokey issued 16 vouchers in the last week. We don't need no stinking training. Towers. Issued six fillers, issued 154, tungsten 180. Okay, so the feature is there. I mean, the feature is there, right? So I reach out to Kayla. I'm like, hey, are you using it? He's like, honestly, I kind of use it sometimes because it's just there and it's so easy. Okay, but I'm like, kayla, but what. But why would anybody on a non water park property be hitting the issue button? Because that means. That means somebody's handing them a wristband when they hit issue, correct? No, this is just a report showing how many were issued per property, not showing who issued it overall. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So. All right, well, the training should be really quick. At least they like it. Yeah, they're already using it. Do I need to talk to Faith then about having somebody at all these properties? And then if we're doing three properties simultaneously, how do we want. Do we want to prioritize? I know we have. Don't we have someone at. What's her name? Danny and Smokey? Can she do Smokey? I can talk to Fate and then. Just someone at Ranch. Okay, and who's responsible for which resorts? Hold on. Between Mia and. I'll get it wrong. I just know their big property. I never can remember their small properties. Hold on. Isn't that the Summit? The Summit is on the eight, right? Summit. It sure is. We can't do that. Where is it? Is it the Lakes? Is that the Villas? Damn. Should I cancel? I have a way out. I don't have to speak. I'm just kidding. Jared goes before me and then I go and then you. God damn it. It's always something giving you all the facts so you have them before you make a decision. Okay, fine. This is the last year for them. Every freaking year. Invite someone else. We just. We could take the two hours and do it together. It's me. Then you just combine the whole thing in two hours. I could. It's really from a training perspective, it's mainly for an office, so. Yeah. Would have to come up. We can come up with something. Yeah. All right. Sorry. That's okay. That just. The eight didn't put two and two together. It's the rollout day and the wow day. The wow Summit. Fun. Well, Bill, this is. It just. It will impact whoever is attending. I guess that wow. Yeah. Summit. Because I was gonna say I could just. I could be at the Lakes that day, but the summit, I mean, I could come over there after the summit but I know if Ray's doing it he likes to do the meetings early like he likes to do 9, 10 o'. Clock. But I guess it just depends on who. But we'll definitely need someone at River Ranch and someone at the lakes. Okay. And honestly the, the assistance that they need was really, it was more system related. Not the system messing up but user system assistance. Okay. Yeah. On the water park side or on. The, on the water park side. Okay. I can't log in. How do I like. Yeah, it was, it was mostly most of that that we dealt with. Okay. Yeah. There's definitely a module right at the beginning of the, of the training on how to like your sans account and all that. Yeah. So but they're still, you're still saying that kind of. I was surprised. I mean keeping people. I mean some of those team members, they, they're not that they're not around computers. Yeah. They have a cell phone but they've never linked. They've never had an account. Right. With Westgate. Right. They've never had to log into an email. They've never had to do any of that. I mean I've probably set up three accounts like as new account because they've never had an account, never had an email, nothing. Okay. So. So there, some of them is just going to be very new to logging into a Westgate computer. So that those were probably some of the assistance that they need. Okay. Do you still want to stick with 9899 is there. Is 98 a holiday? Like is 9 is no. 91. Okay. So yeah, I mean I'm good with. I don't know also what the team members schedules look like or anything like that. Let's do 99. That will probably help a little bit better because Morgan is normally off Monday, Tuesday. Sorry Sunday. Monday. So she'll be there on Tuesday. Okay. And I don't know if that's gonna change by then when they make all these changes. Yeah. So we'll do 99. And then for whoever's going to River Ranch is can they get everybody in one day? I have no idea the size of the team or when they're gonna have to spend multiple days going out to River Ranch. I think one day is fine. I met with the team, the front office team is very small and then I met with the water park team when I was out there. Okay. And it's not, it's not a big team. I think one day. I mean everybody else, the other ones are all local. Yeah. And I think we're given 99. I mean, yeah, we're giving them enough time if we send it out today. I'll send out an email to them today, which I think I. Let me talk to Faith first and just confirm that she's got that the trainers are available. Okay. And then I can let you know then. Yeah, but I'm not sending, like, trainers. Name just, like the dates. Right. Okay. I. Well, I had told them 98 two weeks ago. Or I'll send it to Michelle and have Michelle send it out to them. But. Yeah, so we should be good there. Okay. All right. I think that's. I think that's all the questions that I have for Water park at the moment. Okay. So water park. Check this. What. What else was on the agenda for. Your career path thing? I know I said I would do the on demand suggestions for each thing. I added those in. I just need to hyperlink them. Like, review links to the. Okay. Yeah. So like, for front desk, I did guest service fundamentals. I kind of kept it like 5 or less. I did guest service fundamentals. Handling difficult guest service scenarios and then resolving conflicts are good ones. For the advanced Front desk, I did time management essentials. So it does a guide to workplace integrity. Yes. For cft, Effective feedback strategies, A guide to mentoring others, and then a guide to legal. Perfect. And then Jen is. There's some of her left here because. I know you said they could either go into both or one or the other. Yeah. Business writing fundamentals, project management fundamentals, and then effective feedback strategies. That's one that overlaps. Yeah. Supervisor. Five leadership styles to influence a team. A leader's guide to resolving team conflict, Motivating your team Performance management essentials, and then leading.","📅 **Meeting Overview**: 
The meeting primarily focused on addressing organizational issues in talent acquisition, specifically related to job requisition management. Additionally, discussions covered checklist adjustments, training deployment for the Water Park feature, and operational matters in resort services.

She created a new hire. Her name is McKenzie, but we're not seeing her. So I don't know if you see her somewhere in your back end data. And I have her employee ID number as well. And when we try to re. Add her, it's giving us an error message because it's saying she already exists. But we can't see her anywhere. Okay. So let me. We could look at this together. Let me just share my screen so you guys could see the back end. Always love to see the back end. Don't work. I know. All right. Where is this table thingy? Oh, I hear her. I didn't realize. I figured something was on. I think she was in a mood earlier today. So it was just a new hire, a team member that got added. Correct. The CFT is Katie. And the new hire that she added, her name is Mackenzie or Kenzie. Kenzie. I'm not seeing it either. 8551-785517-85517. Yes. Yeah, it's not showing that it's added. But when you attempted to add her. Oh, right here. Oh, there it is. Okay. Damn. They added a lot of people after that. Wow. So she was added Frontex Smoky Mountain Friendex agent. She. Why is she inactive? I could not see her on the My Manage access page. Unfortunately, to change that and I'm also having issues on that page. That was my second thing I was going to bring up. I cannot make any edits. I can go to the edit page, but there's no submit button. It doesn't lock it in or save it. But yeah, I don't think I saw her on my Manage. Why is this showing that she's inactive? That's weird. We deactivated her, it looks like on 7 21. Was she already in the system from. From way back? It looks like. And she's deactivated. Maybe you know how on the old. The old platform or the old layout, we could see deactivated team members? Yeah. I wonder if this was one of the tests that we did and we just left it deactivated because you can see deactivated team members now. And it kind of just left there. And we didn't reactivate that team member back. It could be. But it's showing that this team member was deactivated back in 721. It could be a test that we did. Honestly, that did that. So let me. I'm looking. Her higher date was July 18th. This team member here. Yeah. Someone def looked like, the deactivated button was hit. And I think back then we had the old. The old layout also. So it's this one. And it did trigger a duplicate, and it was deactivated by this person. Who is this? Okay. All right, so let me set the variable back to one. Can you check? Now she's showing up. I need to. I need to recreate this separate section for deactivated employees. But I'm gonna say this was. She may have touched the deactivated button without realizing back then. Okay. Yeah, I do see her now. Yeah. With progress for 30 days. Okay, I'll have her check and see. That's this one, right, mackenzie? Yes. Yeah, yeah. So that's what happened. I. I believe I'm gonna say on the old one and maybe on this one. You guys remember this one? Jacob? No, I mean, like, you remember this layout, right? Oh, yes. So we have all these deactivated option here. I'm thinking maybe she accidentally. Because that. That's been in there since July something, and maybe she accidentally hit that button without realizing or something, and it just kind of stay there in the back end. But because on the new version or the new layout, the deactivated or not the deactivated are not showing up here like on the old one, because I'm going to separate it and do, like, a separate page just for deactivated. So it doesn't cloud this up. Or I could probably add it as part of the filters here and just put all employees and then deactivated employees or something like that. So you want to see it here. So that's why. But on the other one, we were able to see deactivated employees on the same. So if I deactivated. And I'll. I'll take it back off. But I. If I deactivated. Kind of don't want to deactivate someone because it's going to show the record in the back end. But when I deactivated someone here, it still shows. It just have like a. A gray. Like a gray. What. What was it? It's like a gray highlighted looking. Yeah, but it still shows. But, yeah, so that's. That's what it was. Okay, what was the second thing? The other thing that I had, like I said, in my Manage Access page, I'm specifically trying to change the department that a CFT is in. His name is Asael Gomez. And so when I found his profile, when I clicked Edit, he's just not guest relations. And if I were to select a department, like, there's no save button. On this one. There'S no say. Wow. Okay. I'll take these dogs over. Catastrophic ones. Oh my God, that's funny. There's no save button on the edit page. Okay. All right. Was that, was that the only two things? Yes. Okay. I think any other discussion will probably be all data related. So these are just these little things that the trainers are bringing to me. So. Okay, so far everything is working. As you can see, they're using it, the data's in there, which is good. Pushing for more observations with the trainers and everything. So. Okay. Yeah, no complaints on my end so far. All right, perfect. I did not do my job at all on Wednesday. Oh, unless they did. No. Do you guys want to go through that now? I'm, I'm doing it. I'm starting to look at it on the side right now. Yeah. Okay. I, I didn't know if you wanted to wait because you didn't understand the email or. No, I just didn't. I just didn't do my thought. Okay. Yeah, no, you're right. I was actually. Yeah, I was waiting on the. Yeah, what you said. Okay. So it's good to go. So I can do it now, but I was, I was waiting. Okay. Of course. All right. I mean we could go through them together really quick if you want. I mean, it may take the rest of the call. No, I mean, I can do them. I, I was thinking about what we might need to show on Wednesday. So we need to show copies of the observations. We'll need to show like maybe the 3000 1690s. So the observations on 36 90s are good. So is there any dashboard that you're comfortable kind of showing yet to the gms? I mean we could show them pretty much everything here. I think the, the, this, the 369 dashboard is fine. Yes. I still may need to go back through and make some changes like these. I haven't done these yet, but I'll have that ready by, by Wednesday. I think this dashboard is fine because I don't think any gym is going to look at the numbers and be like, oh, that's incorrect. Right. Just the idea behind the dashboard. So I think this is fine to show them. Which ones are changing and not the performance is changing. 3060 dashboard. Yeah. Oh, hold on. Round one. I should put those menus over there too. So onboarding satisfaction. We're going to keep the percentage here. The last time we discussed, these are going to change to 10 same. So we're not editing any of the 30, 60, 91. So the actual, the actual onboarding satisfaction is 3.8 out of 10. No, because remember the. This measurement first was 1 to 5. I believe we had changed three questions. We change. I don't remember the specific question but I remember was question 8, 9 and then on the 90 day we change question 6 also. 6, 8, 9 and 10. I believe so, yeah. So just like the observation where we have to go back in and make those five, ten, those threes five or however we want to do it, we may have to do the same thing. Also one of the questions I think is the confidence. It was more on a. I don't think it was on a number scale. It was maybe in the back end I was, I was. It was saving as number but it was. Or the feedback. I think it was the feedback. It was positive, negative, whatever. And we also change it too. So now it's looking for a number and it's not looking for that word. I think it was the feedback. So we got to find that one. And I believe it was this one, if I'm not mistaken. Or are this one. I gotta look at it again. Or maybe this one is the same. Because we're going to change the performance observations. But we weren't. We didn't have a plan to change the 30, 60 90s. No, no we did not. So but I think most of these will stay the same. Hold on. So the question that we changed. Let me just actually go back to them real quick so I could understand. So for the 30 and 60, we change confident retention. No, we did 10 too. Right. Our 10 was already like that. So. So that's perfect. So now we just got to go back sa and see what the old database had and I could probably do those too. But we just got to go back in now and see what the old database had because a 10 would be a 5, a 3 would be not. Yeah, a 5 would be a 10, a 3 would be a 5. Right. So if we look at the back end for some of these 36 to 90, then it's going to have scoring from 1 to 5 when it should be from 1 to 10. So we got to make those changes. So the dashboard is going to show. Is always going to show. Why do I keep going to observation? The dashboard is always going to show out of five. So like the performance is one, the confidence is one and the retention. Right. Because these were initially one to five. So it's doing it out of five, it needs to do it out of ten and this is probably up to eight because we probably have had some new scores. Our new survey with, with the 1 to 10 scale. So it's, it's the numbers up there a little bit more. But we still need to go in and make some changes to the old ones. And I can bet if I look at, if I look at the database, it's probably saying the same thing. So if I go to the 369 database, so I could just look at the date. But yeah, so you're gonna have 5 and 10. So all these looks like they're new. Everything in August. And then. Hold on. Oh, so we only have 13. Okay. I also can't get to the completed surveys to edit them. I can't figure out how to get to those. I don't think. I don't perform the observations or the 30, 16, 90. I don't think I had an edit option for the 36 to 90. Did I create. I don't remember if I created one. I know I created an edit option for the observation. Where can I go to the old observations to edit them? Not the old one. Well, so if you go to. If you go to observation here and you open, say like this person. If you open it right, and you scroll to the bottom, there's an edit option here. Okay, got it. No problem. But read the email so you understand, because the one that says not measurable is really observed, unless on the. In the database, it's not measurable. If that makes sense. A little confusing. Oh, okay. Damn. Yeah. Oh, sorry, I was unmuted. I got to the next time. Like, hopefully we don't have to make any more, like, changes like that. But the next time I probably need to, like, download the database, export it to Excel, have it before I go in and do these changes. Just the email. I think you were at it. I don't know why the search name is not coming up. That's weird. Let me close this for a little bit and reopen it. I don't know why my email is acting like this. You're in the old outlook. I never switch. But it never used to act like this because I have so much crap open. You prefer the new one? Okay. This is it right here. Yeah. All right, so you guys got this email, right? Yeah. Okay, so basically, if it's. If it's not measurable, which is going to be 10, you're going to change not measurable to observe. Unless it's marked as NM in the data set, which is the sheet right here. See? Attach. Then keep it as not measurable. And I'll show you what that means in a sec. If it says not observe, we're going to keep it as not observed. If it says observe, we're going to change it to not observe. All right, so let's go through. Let's go through the first one. So I could kind of show you guys what I'm. What I mean. So this Excel sheet is the old database before we Change everyone from 1, 2, 3, NM to observe, not observe, which in the back end is really 10, 0 and NM following? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, sure. Okay. All right. I mean, I understand the changes. I'm just spending more time relating it to the actual observation. All right, so let's, let's. Let's go through that. So if. So this is the new. This is what we want it to be. Right? So this is going to be. Or what is it what it is now? So this is the new version. So if it's a 10, then it's observe. If it's a 0, then it's not observe. So this is Yegord right now. Or is Yegord. Is Yegord real? Yeah, so let's. Let's do that one together. So I'm gonna. I'm gonna walk through that one with you so you could understand what I'm saying. So it's the one that I have highlighted in. In y. These. Right? So this is. This is the new. This is how we have it now. So this is the old one. So three would be 10, right? Observe. The first one for eboard. So this would be zero. One would also be zero. So these would be not observed. This would be the same. And then this would be N M. Does that make sense? Needs to be observed. Unless it's nm in the sheet. Correct. So, dang, what did she measure from this person? So, but do you guys understand this so far make sense? Yeah. You're gonna go into eboards. Yes. Yeah. All right, so I'm gonna put them side by side. And then. So this is. Come on. Okay, so let's start from the top. So why God? All right, so we're looking at this observation. So let's start with general question number one. Right? So general question number one for why God? Ibor Igor. Got a three, Right? So they got a three. So a three back then is converted to a ten. Observe. So this should be. So let's edit real quick. So the first four should be observed. Are you changing it or you want me to change it? Okay, so the first four should be observed. Right? So 1, 2, 3, 4, and then the next three should be not observed because 2, we're doing zero. Also like it. We didn't have a. We didn't have a description. It was just 2, 1, 2, or 3. And then NM. We didn't have, like, a description to it. Like observe, not observe. Should it be something on the center? Like, would it lower the scores overall if you made that zero, too? Oh, yeah. You have to have this be a zero, one or a two, right? Huh. So what we're saying. So a two in the old system was like, we kind of saw it, but it needs work. But in the new system, we either observed it or we didn't. Correct. So what do we want group that score to be? Does that go to zero or does that go to observed? Because there is no longer like, oh, it needs work. Right. What do you want to put that under? Do you want to put it under observe or. Or not observe? How many entries do you have so far that would be changed by this? Every single observation. Observation that was done before. It's the ones in front of you, Ray? Yeah. Yeah. Pretty much everything that was done before August, all the observations. So there's only like, what, a dozen in here? Yeah, probably. Yeah. Okay, so it doesn't sound like a change in these scores would be that big of a variable to consider. No, I would say we leave it at zero. What are y' all thinking? I agree with that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So not observed in will not move. Is that correct, Omar? Yeah. So we'll leave these as not. So. Yeah, and that's kind of what I put. Not observe. Will just stay not observe. So that's what you put in your email. I agree with. Yeah. 1, 2, 3, 4, which is this 1, 2, 3, 4. And then we have 1, 2, 3 that are twos, which is 1, 2, 3. And then if you realize also. So we have the 1, 2, 3, which is twos, but this one, which is general question number we do. So it needs to be observe because it's a three, and then the first. So now we're in the SA role. The first role, roll one, is showing three, but it's showing NM here. So that's why I meant by if it's showing NM, just check to make sure it's not actual NM. But if it's a 3, then you move it to observe. Little confusing. And then the second role question is also a three. So it's going to be observe. And then there is a not observe, which is number three, but it's shown as an nm. Oh, that's kind of off. And then number. Hold on, I got confused. Let's go back up. So three. So that's correct. No, this should. So hold on. Now let's see what you guys waited for me. Okay, so three, two, two, three. So roll. So this is three. Two should be not observed. And then roll three. This should be observed. So this is what it looks like. Yeah, but because these are all two back in the days like so unless you want to switch these SA to observe. But yeah, because this would have. These would. Most of these would have been two which would have helped the score because right now this score is 4.7. Being that. Right. Faith, I know I lost you guys like five minutes ago, but that really makes me think now it's just back up, man. Oh, what are we thinking? Can we go to the top really quick? One more? Yeah. So the all of the not observed. Because in this instance Mia really didn't get to see a lot. No, I guess that's fair. Okay, so scored a 2.5 on their role specific observation out of 10. So this is going to highlight a lot I think in the. In the properties. But this person was being observed. But remember this is based on a three or four scale scoring where back then we were also looking for somewhat incompliant. Right. Oh, maybe they have everything on. But I don't know. Well, I don't know what they were looking at at that time. But the two would suggest that they are incompliant 90. But something is missing. That's why they got a two. Yeah. So exactly. Right. So like what Omar is saying and one placement really like where we would want to like if the training specialist sees that that's like horrific checking. Right. And I don't know, you know, I know we're going back and forth on like how we measure and how we put non measurable or not, you know, so maybe it doesn't show as bad. But like that's one where you step in, you walk into the back and you're like Jeff, you won't believe what I just saw. Like you need to take care of this right away. So I don't know, you know, that's just kind of what I'm what I was thinking there with this. So I don't know because I mean. This two could mean because again these were two. So it's not like they just. Maybe in this one they. They confirmed the room type but they didn't confirm the rate. What's the comment on this? Because I wonder if this came up when Danny had mentioned that all of our observations right now are check in specific and if this wasn't like. Granted I wouldn't have had her fill this out if it wasn't an actual check in. But I wonder if it was disclosed anywhere in the comment. But she, but if that happens, Faith, we just put not measurable because then the scoring will ignore that. It won't count that against them. So again this one might have been just in the early days where we're learning how to fill out still. But as we get further in, right. Like you know, if you, if there's no chance to even score this, it's not fair. Right. We put not measurable here. Right. Omer, this is calculating, this is ignoring not measurable for the calculations at the top, right? Yeah, yeah it is, it is. So it's. This is scoring out of 19 rather than out of 22 because three were not measurable. Yes. I have to offer my four o'. Clock. So I would say think about this. I mean you guys let me know, I could probably work on most of them. You want to keep it like this. Just train the training specialist on any. Any further that we want to, we want to look at. Yeah, it's not going to help us nor you Omar, as a compliance of this. Right. So yeah, I agree. I'll take care of these though if you, if you consider taking care of the 3060 90s, I'll take care of these. Okay, I understand now. And I wrote down some extra notes for myself so I'll get these changed today. Okay. There, there. So but based on what I did here, like it's. It should be self explanatory. I mean all the threes will be observed because the threes would equate to 10 in how we're doing it now. Twos and ones would be zero and NM would be NM. There are about three. Three team members or three observation that that is missing. I. I got to look for the database, the backup database that have those three. But other than that everyone else is there in that Excel sheet. Can you, can you. I gotta drop 4 o'. Clock. Can you do 3 to 4 tomorrow for me and you, Omar? Yes. Yeah, I should be on to number three to four. Let's see. All right. Ray, Faith, you don't have to go to this one that you're about to get the email for. Actually hold on. Can we do four? Actually I could do three to four. I could move this to four. I have a one on one in Cocoa. Beach. But yeah, yeah, let's do three to four. Yeah. All right. Yeah. All right. All right. So. Right. Faith, you're about to get this, but you don't need to be at this meeting. This is just me. No more talking about the presentation on Wednesday. Okay. All right, Bye. All right. Good to be sure. Thank you. Cool. Was there anything else that you guys had? It's sa. It's. Good, man. How are you? It's. SA. Hello? Hi. Hi. Are you busy? No, I can. I can listen. What's up? No, I can listen. I'm just typing or finish finishing up a code. About Jul. I've been annoyed all day. And then she. Me too. You what? Did you read Julie's email? No, I haven't checked my email in a little bit. She said there's an update coming for September. As of now, it looks like the 10th. It could slide back to the 24th, depending on the rest of development testing. Our next scheduled call. Our next social meeting is the fifth, and I'm sure that won't be enough time to get info put together. Would you like me to look at time this week for us to touch back on the new feature? Yeah. What if it's the same feature that. Do you know that? That's what it is. I mean, that's what she told me. It was just a receipt printed. I mean, it's just where to go to print the receipt. But I. We didn't get into details. I don't think she know those details when I spoke to her a few weeks ago. So I guess it's not that big of a deal. But. Yeah, Well, I mean, if you want to set up something. If you want to set up something, I mean, we could. I mean, do you just want to ask her? Do you want to respond to the email and say, all right, thank you, sir? Yeah. When I. Yeah, I'll probably write to it later or once I finish this. But yeah, I could just say I. I believe based on what we discussed, this is not. This doesn't require like major training or something because it's just print. Just a print receipt. The receipt feature being added or something like that. Yeah. So I can reply. You say, I. I believe this one should be fairly easy and doesn't require a. Like an actual whatever since it's just the receipt being added is just how to print the receipt. But I. You guys don't work. You don't. You don't work on their training manual. Right. Because I believe Kathleen has all those information already or all those screenshot well. That'S part of the problem with Johanna and sa. I mean, I want to say. No. Okay. As part of the problem. And that's something I tried to very tactfully bring up to her on our call last week without saying, like, this before, but I was like, you guys have stuff in way too many places. I think your bigger problem, like, wow is is that if I need to find something, I can go to two different places to find it, and all 10 of those places may not be updated. I was like, you want to think about the last email you sent? You put in all these locations. Like, you shouldn't be updating things in all those locations. Like, if you have a wow. SharePoint, like, why do you also think you need the documentation? Like, that separate documentation of a book? Like, that's time license. I just don't really understand. Then we have a training, and then our training, like, update. Just the amount of money being spent to, like, keep materials updated for a while, in my opinion, is a little crazy. And it should all live in one place. But no, that's why we wouldn't create a manual for them. This was a whole thing when Victor was here. Because again, it did not. It didn't make sense. Right? Like, hold on. Sorry. I'm getting, like, three different texts based on the thing that I'm working on. Huh. I was just gonna answer them now. Like, I have. I have, like, four emails. Two of them that. Because the way I'm going to reply to it, I'm like, hey, I believe LND has Kathleen from. LND has all these screenshots already if you want to reach out to her. Okay. Yeah. Tell me what the email says. You'Ll be. You want me call you on teams? Yeah. All right, let me do that. Okay. It. Hello? Okay. Oh, that was loud. I'm sorry. I was laughing at my team. Sorry. They're, like, yelling across the hall. Right before I. All right, so this one I need Diane. That I could do later. So this one from Julie. So they sent an email, and of course, you know, she include everyone. Diana, Sheena. I'm currently reviewing the World Loyalty Training Guide and notice that we still have images from Mr. Sums. We need new screenshots from FriendX console to update the guide. Is there a way to. To access FDC for these images? Please let me know. If not, could you or your team assist with the attached document? And then she's like, omar, is this something you want to handle or something you need my team to handle? So it was originally from Joanna. So Let me see the attached. Document. It. I think Valeria has.","📅 **Meeting Overview**: The purpose of the meeting was to address technical issues related to the onboarding and management system for new hires, specifically focusing on the issue of a new hire, McKenzie, not appearing correctly in the system. The meeting also included discussions on dashboard updates and data correction processes.

🎯 **Key Decisions Made**:
- McKenzie's status was corrected from 'inactive' to 'active,' resolving her visibility issue in the system.
- Confirmation to update and correct dashboard scoring systems from a scale of 1-5 to a scale of 1-10.
- Agreement to investigate and potentially update old data entries to reflect the new scoring system.

📋 **Action Items**:
- **Omar** will refine the system to allow the visibility of deactivated employees separately.
- **Omar** to provide training on the updated observation and scoring system.
- **Faith & Omar** to meet separately to discuss the presentation details for Wednesday.
- **Faith** to update scoring entries in line with the new system changes.

💡 **Important Discussions**:
- Discussions on how previous employees might have been deactivated due to system layout changes and accidental deactivation.
- Problem with no save button on the ""Manage Access"" page, specifically affecting department changes for employees like Asael Gomez.
- The need to adjust old observation data to fit the new 1-10 system was discussed at length.
- The choice of whether scores of 2 on the previous scale should be converted to observed or not observed under the new system.
- Discussion about the inefficiencies in documentation storage and accessibility was brought up, suggesting a need for consolidation.

⚠️ **Risks & Issues**:
- Potential discrepancies in dashboard scores if outdated data isn't updated.
- Current documentation practices may lead to outdated or duplicated information being used.

📅 **Next Meeting/Follow-up**:
- Next meeting slated for tomorrow between 3-4 PM for Omar and relevant team to finalize presentation details for Wednesday.
- Participants not required for tomorrow’s meeting will receive updates via email.
- Further follow-up on any outstanding technical issues and documentation practices expected.","[{""title"": ""Investigate Deactivated Employee Access Issue"", ""dueDate"": null, ""assignee"": ""Backend Team"", ""category"": ""development"", ""priority"": ""high"", ""description"": ""Check backend data to resolve issue with McKenzie's access status.

She created a new hire. Her name is McKenzie, but we're not seeing her. So I don't know if you see her somewhere in your back end data. And I have her employee ID number as well. And when we try to re add her, it's giving us an error message because it's saying she already exists. But we can't see her anywhere. Okay. So let me. We could look at this together. Let me just share my screen so you guys could see the back end. Always love to see the back end. Don't work. I know. All right. Where is this table thingy? Oh, I hear her. I didn't realize. I figured something was on. I think she was in a mood earlier today. So it was just a new hire, a team member that got added. Correct. The CFT is Katie. And the new hire that she added, her name is Mackenzie or Kenzie. Kenzie. I'm not seeing it either. 8551-785517-85517. Yes. Yeah, it's not showing that it's added. But when you attempted to add her. Oh, right here. Oh, there it is. Okay. Damn. They added a lot of people after that. Wow. So she was added frontex Smoky Mountain Friendex agent. She. Why is she inactive? I could not see her on the My Manage access page. Unfortunately, to change that and I'm also having issues on that page. That was my second thing I was going to bring up. I cannot make any edits. I can go to the edit page, but there's no submit button. It doesn't lock it in or save it. But yeah, I don't think I saw her on my Manage. Why is this showing that she's inactive? That's weird. We deactivated her. It looks like on 7 21. Was she already in the system from. From way back? It looks like. And she's deactivated. Maybe you know how on the old. The old platform or the old layout, we could see deactivated team members? Yeah. I wonder if this was one of the tests that we did and we just left it deactivated because you can see deactivated team members now. And it kind of just left there. And we didn't reactivate that team member back. It could be. But it's showing that this team member was deactivated back in 721. It could be a test that we did. Honestly, that did that. So let me. Look at her higher date was July 18th. This team member here. Yeah. Someone def looked like the Deactivated button was hit. And I think back then we had the old. The old layout also. So it's this one. And it did trigger a duplicate, and it was deactivated by this person. Who is this? Okay. All right, so let me set the variable back to one. Can you check? Now she's showing up. I need to. I need to recreate this separate section for deactivated employees. But I'm gonna say this was. She may have touched the deactivated button without realizing back then. Okay. Yeah, I do see her now. Yeah. With progress for 30 days. Okay, I'll have her check and see. That's this one, right, mackenzie? Yes. Yeah, yeah. So that's what happened. I. I believe I'm gonna say on the old one and maybe on this one. You guys remember this one? Jacob? No, I mean, like, you remember this layout, right? Oh, yes. So we have all these deactivated option here. I'm thinking maybe she accidentally. Because that. That's been in there since July something. And maybe she accidentally hit that button without realizing or something, and it just kind of stay there in the back end. But because on the new version or the new layout, the deactivated or not the deactivated are not showing up here like on the old one, because I'm going to separate it and do like a separate page just for deactivated. So it doesn't cloud this up. Or I could probably add it as part of the filters here and just put all employees and then deactivated employees or something like that. So you want to see it here. So that's why. But on the other one, we were able to see deactivated employees on the same. So if I deactivated. And I'll. I'll take it back off. But I. If I deactivated. Kind of don't want to deactivate someone because it's going to show the record in the back end. But when I deactivated someone here, it still shows. It just have like a. A gray. Like a gray. What. What was it? It's like a gray highlighted looking. Yeah, but it still shows. But yeah, so that's. That's what it was. Okay, what was the second thing? The other thing that I had, like I said, in my Manage Access page, I'm specifically trying to change the department that a CFT is in. His name is Asael Gomez. And so when I found his profile, when I clicked Edit, he's just not Guest relations. And if I were to select a department, like, there's no save button on this One. There'S no say. Wow. Okay. I'll take these dogs over. Catastrophic ones. Oh my God. That's funny. There's no save button on the edit page. Okay. All right. Was that, was that the only two things? Yes. Okay. I think any other discussion will probably be all data related. So these are just these little things that the trainers are bringing to me. So. Okay, so far everything is working. As you can see, they're using it. The data's in there, which is good. Pushing for more observations with the trainers and everything. So. Okay. Yeah, no complaints on my end so far. All right, perfect. I did not do my job at all on Wednesday. Oh, unless they did. No. Do you guys want to go through that now? I'm, I'm doing it. I'm starting to look at it on the side right now. Yeah. Okay. I, I didn't know if you wanted to wait because you didn't understand the email or. No, I just didn't. I just didn't do my thought. Okay. Yeah, no, you're right. I was actually. Yeah, I was waiting on the. Yeah, what you said. Okay, so it's good to go. So I can do it now, but I was, I was waiting. Okay. Of course. All right. I mean we could go through them together really quick if you want. I mean it may take the rest of the call. No, I mean, I can do them. I, I was thinking about what we might need to show on Wednesday. So we need to show copies of the observations. We'll need to show like maybe the 3000 1690s. So the observations on 36 90s are good. So is there any dashboard that you're comfortable kind of showing yet to the gms? I mean we could show them pretty much everything here. I think the, the, this, the 369 dashboard is fine. Yes. I still may need to go back through and make some changes like these. I haven't done these yet, but I'll have that ready by, by Wednesday. I think this dashboard is fine because I don't think any gym is going to look at the numbers and be like, oh, that's incorrect. Right. Just the idea behind the dashboard. So I think this is fine to show them. Which ones are changing and not the performance is changing. 3060 dashboard. Yeah. Oh, hold on. Round one. I should put those menus over there too. So onboarding satisfaction. We're going to keep the percentage here. The last time we discussed, these are going to change to 10 same. So we're not editing any of the 30, 60, 91. So the actual, the actual onboarding satisfaction is 3.8 out of 10. No, because remember the. This measurement first was 1 to 5. I believe we had changed three questions. We change. I don't remember the specific question, but I remember was question 8, 9 and then on the 90 day we change question 6 also. 6, 8, 9 and 10. I believe so, yeah. So just like the observation where we have to go back in and make those five, ten, those threes five or however we want to do it, we may have to do the same thing. Also one of the questions I think is the confidence. It was more on a. I don't think it was on a number scale. It was maybe in the back end I was, I was. It was saving as number but it was. Or the feedback. I think it was the feedback. It was positive, negative, whatever. And we also change it too. So now it's looking for a number and it's not looking for that word. I think it was the feedback. So we got to find that one. And I believe it was this one, if I'm not mistaken. Or are this one. I gotta look at it again. Or maybe this one is the same. Because we're going to change the performance observations. But we weren't. We didn't have a plan to change the 30, 60 90s. No, no, we did not. So but I think most of these will stay the same. Hold on. So the question that we changed. Let me just actually go back to them real quick so I could understand. So for the 30 and 60, we change confident retention. No, we did 10 too. Right. Our 10 was already like that. So. So that's perfect. So now we just got to go back sa and see what the old database had. And I could probably do those too. But we just got to go back in now and see what the old database had because a 10 would be a 5, a 3 would be not. Yeah, a 5 would be a 10, a 3 would be a 5. Right. So if we look at the back end for some of these 36 to 90, then it's going to have scoring from 1 to 5 when it should be from 1 to 10. So we got to make those changes. So the dashboard is going to show. Is always going to show. Why do I keep going to observation? The dashboard is always going to show out of five. So like the performance is one, the confidence is one and the retention. Right. Because these were initially one to five. So it's doing it out of five, it needs to do it out of ten and this is probably up to eight because we probably have had some new scores. Our new survey with. With the one to ten scale. So it's. It's the numbers up there a little bit more. But we still need to go in and make some changes to the old ones. And I can bet if I look at. If I look at the database, it's probably saying the same thing. So if I go to the 369 database, so I could just look at the date. But yeah, so you're gonna have 5 and 10. So all these looks like they're new. Everything in August. And then. Hold on. Oh, so we only have 13. Okay. I also can't get to the completed surveys to edit them. I can't figure out how to get to those. I don't think. I don't perform the observations or the 30, 16, 90. I don't think I had an edit option for the 36 to 90. Did I create. I don't remember if I created one. I know I created an edit option for the observation. Where can I go to the old observations to edit them? Not the old one. Well, so if you go to. If you go to observation here and you open, say like this person. If you open it right, and you scroll to the bottom, there's an edit option here. Okay, got it. No problem. But read the email so you understand, because the one that says not measurable is really observed, unless on the. In the database, it's not measurable. If that makes sense. A little confusing. Oh, okay. Damn. Yeah. Oh, sorry, I was unmuted. I got to the next time. Like, hopefully we don't have to make any more, like, changes like that. But the next time I probably need to, like, download the database, export it to Excel, have it before I go in and do these changes. Just the email. I think you were at it. I don't know why the search name is not coming up. That's weird. Let me close this for a little bit and reopen it. I don't know why my email is acting like this. You're in the old outlook. I never switch. But it never used to act like this because I have so much crap open. You prefer the new one? Okay. This is it right here. Yeah. All right. So you guys got this email, right? Yeah. Okay, so basically, if it's. If it's not measurable, which is going to be 10, you're going to change not measurable to observe. Unless it's marked as NM in the data set, which is the sheet right here. See? Attach. Then keep it as not measurable, and I'll show you what that means in a sec. If it says not observe, we're going to keep it as not observed. If it says observe, we're going to change it to not observe. All right, so let's go through. Let's go through the first one. So I could kind of show you guys what I'm. What I mean. So this Excel sheet is the old database before we Change everyone from 1, 2, 3, NM to observe, not observe, which in the back end is really 10, 0, and NM following? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, sure. Okay. All right. I mean, I understand the changes. I'm just spending more time relating it to the actual observation. All right, so let's. Let's. Let's go through that. So if. So this is the new. This is what we want it to be. Right? So this is going to be. Or what is it what it is now? So this is the new version. So if it's a 10, then it's observe. If it's a 0, then it's not observe. So this is Yegord right now. Or is Yegord. Is Yegord real? Yeah, so let's. Let's do that one together. So I'm gonna. I'm gonna walk through that one with you so you could understand what I'm saying. So it's the one that I have highlighted in. In y. These. Right? So this is. This is the new. This is how we have it now. So this is the old one. So three would be 10, right? Observe. The first one for eboard. So this would be zero. One would also be zero. So these would be not observed. This would be the same. And then this would be N M. Does that make sense? Needs to be observed. Unless it's nm in the sheet. Correct. So, dang, what did she measure from this person? So, but do you guys understand this so far? Make sense? Yeah. You're gonna go into eboards. Yes. Yeah. All right, so I'm gonna put them side by side. And then. So this is. Come on. Okay, so let's start from the top. So why God? All right, so we're looking at this observation. So let's start with general question number one. Right? So general question number one for why God? Ibor Igor. Got a three, right? So they got a three. So a three back then is converted to a ten. Observe. So this should be. So let's edit real quick. So the first four should be observed. Are you changing it or you want me to change it? Okay, so the first four should be observed, right? So 1, 2, 3, 4, and then the next three should be not observed because 2, we're doing zero also like it. We didn't have a. We didn't have a description. It was just 2, 1, 2, or 3 and then NM. We didn't have, like, a description to it. Like observe, not observe. Should it be something on the center? Like, would it lower the scores overall if you made that zero, too? Oh, yeah. You have to have this be a 0, 1 or a 2, right? Huh. So what we're saying. So a 2 in the old system was like, we kind of saw it, but it needs work. But in the new system, we either observed it or we didn't. Correct. So what do we want group that score to be? Does that go to zero or does that go to observed? Because there is no longer like, oh, it needs work. Right. What do you want to put that under? Do you want to put it under observe or. Or not observe? How many entries do you have so far that would be changed by this? Every single observation. Observation that was done before. It's the ones in front of you, Ray? Yeah. Yeah. Pretty much everything that was done before August, all the observations. So there's only like, what, a dozen in here? Yeah, probably. Yeah. Okay, so it doesn't sound like a change in these scores would be that big of a variable to consider. No, I would say we leave it at zero. What are y' all thinking? I agree with that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So not observed in will not move. Is that correct, Omar? Yeah. So we'll leave these as not. So. Yeah, and that's kind of what I put. Not observe. Will just stay not observe. So that's what you put in your email. I agree with. Yeah. 1, 2, 3, 4, which is this 1, 2, 3, 4. And then we have 1, 2, 3 that are twos, which is 1, 2, 3. And then if you realize also. So we have the 1, 2, 3, which is twos, but this one, which is general question number we do. So it needs to be observe because it's a three, and then the first. So now we're in the SA role. The first role, roll one, is showing three, but it's showing NM here. So that's why I meant by if it's showing NM, just check to make sure it's not actual NM. But if it's a 3, then you move it to observe. Little confusing. And then the second role question is also a three. So it's going to be observe. And then there is a not observe, which is number three, but it's shown as an nm. Oh, that's kind of off. And then number. Hold on, I got confused. Let's go back up. So three. So that's correct. No, this should. So hold on. Now let's see what you guys waited for me. Okay, so three, two, two, three. So roll. So this is three. Two should be not observed. And then roll three. This should be observed. So this is what it looks like. Yeah, but because these are all two back in the days like so unless you want to switch these sa to observe. But yeah, because this would have. These would. Most of these would have been two which would have helped the score because right now this score is 4.7. Being that. Right. Faith, I know I lost you guys like five minutes ago, but that really makes me think now it's just back up, man. Oh, what are we thinking? Can we go to the top really quick? One more? Yeah. So the all of the not observed because in this instance Mia really didn't get to see a lot. No, I guess that's fair. Okay, so scored a 2.5 on their role specific observation out of 10. So this is going to highlight a lot I think in the, in the properties. But this person was being observed. But remember this is based on a three or four scale scoring where back then we were also looking for somewhat incompliant. Right. Oh maybe they have everything on. But I don't know. Well I don't know what they were looking at at that time. But the two would suggest that they are incompliant 90. But something is missing. That's why they got a two. Yeah. So exactly. Right. So like what Omar is saying and one placement really like where we would want to like if the training specialist sees that that's like horrific checking. Right. And I don't know, you know, I know we're going back and forth on like how we measure and how we put non measurable or not, you know, so maybe it doesn't show as bad but like that's one where you step in, you walk into the back and you're like Jeff, you won't believe what I just saw. Like you need to take care of this right away. So I don't know. You know, that's just kind of what I'm what I was thinking there with this. So I don't know because I mean. This two could mean because again these were two. So it's not like they just. Maybe in this one they, they confirmed the room type but they didn't confirm the rate. What's the comment on this? Because I wonder if this Came up when Danny had mentioned that all of our observations right now are check in specific. And if this wasn't like granted I wouldn't have had her fill this out if it wasn't an actual check in. But I wonder if it was disclosed. Anywhere in the comment. But she, but if that happens, Faith, we just put not measurable because then the scoring will ignore that. It won't count that against them. So again this one might have been just in the early days where we're learning how to fill out still. But as we get further in, right. Like you know, if you, if there's no chance to even score this, it's not fair. Right. We put not measurable here. Right. Omer, this is calculating, this is ignoring not measurable for the calculations at the top, right? Yeah, yeah it is, it is. So it's. This is scoring out of 19 rather than out of 22 because three were not measurable. Yes. I have to offer my four o'. Clock. So I would say think about this. I mean you guys let me know, I could probably work on most of them. You want to keep it like this. Just train the training specialist on any. Any further that we want to. We want to look at. Yeah, it's not going to help us nor you Omar, as a compliance of this. Right, so. Yeah, I agree. I'll take care of these though if you, if you consider taking care of the 3060 90s, I'll take care of these. Okay, I understand now. And I wrote down some extra notes for myself so I'll get these changed today. Okay. There, there. So but based on what I did here, like it's. It should be self explanatory. I mean all the threes will be observed because the threes would equate to 10 in how we're doing it now. Twos and ones would be zero and NM would be NM. There are about three. Three team members or three observation that that is missing. I. I got to look for the database, the backup database that have those three. But other than that everyone else is there in that Excel sheet. Can you, can you. I gotta drop 4 o'. Clock. Can you do 3 to 4 tomorrow for me and you, Omar? Yes. Yeah, I should be on to number three to four. Let's see. All right, Ray, Faith, you don't have to go to this one that you're about to get the email for. Actually hold on. Can we do four? Actually I could do three to four. I could move this to four. I have a one on one in Cocoa beach, but yeah. Yeah. Let's do three to four. Yeah. All right. Yeah. All right. All right. So. Right, you're about to get this. But you don't need to be at this meeting. This is just me. No more talking about the presentation on Wednesday. Okay. All right, bye. All right. Good to be sure. Thank you. Cool. Was there anything else that you guys had? It's sa. It's. Good, man. How are you? It's. It's sa. Hello? Hi. Hi. Are you busy? No, I can. I can listen. What's up? No, I can listen. I'm just typing or finish finishing up a code. About Jul. I've been annoyed all day. And then she. Me too. You what? Did you read Julie's email? No, I haven't checked my email in a little bit. She said there's an update coming for September. As of now, it looks like the 10th. It could slide back to the 24th depending on the rest of development testing. Our next scheduled call. Our next social meeting is the fifth. And I'm sure that won't be enough time to get info put together. Would you like me to look at time this week for us to touch back on the new feature? Yeah. What if it's the same feature that. Do you know that? That's what it is. I mean, that's what she told me. It was just a receipt printed. I mean, it's just where to go to print the receipt. But I. We didn't get into details. I don't think she know those details when I spoke to her a few weeks ago. So I guess it's not that big of a deal. But. Yeah, well, I mean, if you want to set up something. If you want to set up something, I mean, we could. I mean, do you just want to ask her? Do you want to respond to the email and say, all right, thank you, sir? Yeah, when I. Yeah, I'll probably write to it later or once I finish this. But yeah, I could just say I. I believe based on what we discussed, this is not. This doesn't require like major training or something because it's just print. Just a print receipt. The receipt feature being added or something like that. Yeah. So I can reply. You say, I. I believe this one should be fairly easy and doesn't require a. Like an actual whatever since it's just the receipt being added is just how to print the receipt. But I. You guys don't work. You don't. You don't work on their training manual. Right. Because I believe Kathleen has all those information already or all those screenshot well. That'S part of the problem with Johanna and sa. I mean, I want to say. No. Okay. As part of the problem with Johanna. And that's something I tried to very tactfully bring up to her on our call last week without saying, like, this before, but I was like, you guys have stuff in way too many places. I think your bigger problem, like, wow is is that if I need to find something, I can go to two different places to find it, and all 10 of those places may not be updated. I was like, you want to think about the last email you sent? You put in all these locations. Like, you shouldn't be updating things in all those locations. Like, if you have a wow. SharePoint, like, why do you also think you need the documentation? Like, that separate documentation of a book? Like, that's time license. I just don't really understand. Then we have a training, and then our training, like, update. Just the amount of money being spent to, like, keep materials updated for a while, in my opinion, is a little crazy. And it should all live in one place. But no, that's why we wouldn't create a manual for them. This was a whole thing when Victor was here. Because again, it did not. It didn't make sense. Right? Like, hold on. Sorry. I'm getting, like, three different texts based on the thing that I'm working on. Huh. I was just gonna answer them now. Like, I have. I have, like, four emails. Two of them that. Because the way I'm going to reply to it, I'm like, hey, I believe LND has Kathleen from LND has all these screenshots already if you want to reach out to her. Okay. Yeah. Tell me what the email says. You'Ll be. You want me call you on teams? Yeah. All right, let me do that. Okay. It. Hello? Okay. Oh, that was loud. I'm sorry. I was laughing at my team. Sorry. They're, like, yelling across the hall. Right before I. All right, so this one I need Diane. That I could do later. So this one from Julie. So they sent an email, and of course, you know, she include everyone. Diana, Sheena. I'm currently reviewing the World Loyalty Training Guide and notice that we still have images from Mr. Sums. We need new screenshots from FriendX console to update the guide. Is there a way to. To access FDC for these images? Please let me know. If not, could you or your team assist with the attached document? And then she's like, omar, is this something you want to handle or something you need my team to handle? So it was originally from Joanna. So let me see the attached document. It. I think Valeria has.","📅 **Meeting Overview**: The meeting primarily addressed technical issues related to the onboarding system and employee management interface, with an emphasis on troubleshooting and system improvements.

🎯 **Key Decisions Made**:
- It was determined that McKenzie, a new hire, was mistakenly deactivated in the system. The issue was discovered to be due to a test case from an old platform layout.
- The edit function for employee department assignment needs attention as there is no save button currently available.

📋 **Action Items**:
- Omar to recreate a separate section for deactivated employees to avoid confusion with active listings. (Deadline: Next update cycle)
- The team to update the 30-60-90-day dashboards with the new score scale to standardize performance metrics.
- Faith to edit existing scores in past observations to match the new observation criteria. (Target completion: end of day today)
- Asael Gomez's profile department needs updating once system edit issue is resolved. (Owner: Assigned IT Support)

💡 **Important Discussions**:
- The need to add a filter for deactivated employees in the system to segregate active and inactive status.
- Discussion on the implications of mid-year changes to employee observation evaluation, focusing on converting old data for consistency.
- Consensus to leave scores of '2' from previous systems as 'not observed' within the new system parameters.
- Potential update needed for system training materials, aligning with new platform features and screen captures.

⚠️ **Risks & Issues**:
- Inactive employee records had been misleading due to backend test configurations.
- The absence of a save function on the department edit page could impact personnel changes and records accuracy.
- There are discrepancies in data migration from old to new systems regarding scoring metrics, which may affect historical data integrity.

📅 **Next Meeting/Follow-up**:
- Next session with Omar and key IT personnel scheduled for 3-4 PM the following day to prepare presentation material for an upcoming review.
- The team is set to prepare a demonstration of current dashboards and operational metrics for the GMs meeting slated for Wednesday.
- Update and discussion with Julie to clarify upcoming platform updates and their training implications at the next scheduled call.","[{""title"": ""Reactivate deactivated team member, Mackenzie"", ""dueDate"": null, ""assignee"": null, ""category"": ""development"", ""priority"": ""high"", ""description"": ""Ensure Mackenzie is visible in the system as she was mistakenly deactivated.

She created a new hire. Her name is McKenzie, but we're not seeing her. So I don't know if you see her somewhere in your back end data. And I have her employee ID number as well. And when we try to re add her, it's giving us an error message because it's saying she already exists. But we can't see her anywhere. Okay. So let me. We could look at this together. Let me just share my screen so you guys could see the back end. Always love to see the back end. Don't work. I know. All right. Where is this table thingy? Oh, I hear her. I didn't realize. I figured something was on. I think she was in a mood earlier today. So it was just a new hire, a team member that got added. Correct. The CFT is Katie. And the new hire that she added, her name is Mackenzie or Kenzie. Kenzie. I'm not seeing it either. 8551-785517-85517. Yes. Yeah, it's not showing that it's added. But when you attempted to add her. Oh, right here. Oh, there it is. Okay. Damn. They added a lot of people after that. Wow. So she was added frontex Smoky Mountain Friendex agent. She. Why is she inactive? I could not see her on the My Manage access page. Unfortunately, to change that and I'm also having issues on that page. That was my second thing I was going to bring up. I cannot make any edits. I can go to the edit page, but there's no submit button. It doesn't lock it in or save it. But yeah, I don't think I saw her on my Manage. Why is this showing that she's inactive? That's weird. We deactivated her. It looks like on 7 21. Was she already in the system from. From way back? It looks like. And she's deactivated. Maybe you know how on the old. The old platform or the old layout, we could see deactivated team members? Yeah. I wonder if this was one of the tests that we did and we just left it deactivated because you can see deactivated team members now. And it kind of just left there. And we didn't reactivate that team member back. It could be. But it's showing that this team member was deactivated back in 721. It could be a test that we did. Honestly, that did that. So let me. Look at her higher date was July 18th. This team member here. Yeah. Someone def looked like the Deactivated button was hit. And I think back then we had the old. The old layout also. So it's this one. And it did trigger a duplicate, and it was deactivated by this person. Who is this? Okay. All right, so let me set the variable back to one. Can you check? Now she's showing up. I need to. I need to recreate this separate section for deactivated employees. But I'm gonna say this was. She may have touched the deactivated button without realizing back then. Okay. Yeah, I do see her now. Yeah. With progress for 30 days. Okay, I'll have her check and see. That's this one, right, mackenzie? Yes. Yeah, yeah. So that's what happened. I. I believe I'm gonna say on the old one and maybe on this one. You guys remember this one? Jacob? No, I mean, like, you remember this layout, right? Oh, yes. So we have all these deactivated option here. I'm thinking maybe she accidentally. Because that. That's been in there since July something. And maybe she accidentally hit that button without realizing or something, and it just kind of stay there in the back end. But because on the new version or the new layout, the deactivated or not the deactivated are not showing up here like on the old one, because I'm going to separate it and do like a separate page just for deactivated. So it doesn't cloud this up. Or I could probably add it as part of the filters here and just put all employees and then deactivated employees or something like that. So you want to see it here. So that's why. But on the other one, we were able to see deactivated employees on the same. So if I deactivated. And I'll. I'll take it back off. But I. If I deactivated. Kind of don't want to deactivate someone because it's going to show the record in the back end. But when I deactivated someone here, it still shows. It just have like a. A gray. Like a gray. What. What was it? It's like a gray highlighted looking. Yeah, but it still shows. But yeah, so that's. That's what it was. Okay, what was the second thing? The other thing that I had, like I said, in my Manage Access page, I'm specifically trying to change the department that a CFT is in. His name is Asael Gomez. And so when I found his profile, when I clicked Edit, he's just not Guest relations. And if I were to select a department, like, there's no save button on this One. There'S no say. Wow. Okay. I'll take these dogs over. Catastrophic ones. Oh my God. That's funny. There's no save button on the edit page. Okay. All right. Was that, was that the only two things? Yes. Okay. I think any other discussion will probably be all data related. So these are just these little things that the trainers are bringing to me. So. Okay, so far everything is working. As you can see, they're using it. The data's in there, which is good. Pushing for more observations with the trainers and everything. So. Okay. Yeah, no complaints on my end so far. All right, perfect. I did not do my job at all on Wednesday. Oh, unless they did. No. Do you guys want to go through that now? I'm, I'm doing it. I'm starting to look at it on the side right now. Yeah. Okay. I, I didn't know if you wanted to wait because you didn't understand the email or. No, I just didn't. I just didn't do my thought. Okay. Yeah, no, you're right. I was actually. Yeah, I was waiting on the. Yeah, what you said. Okay, so it's good to go. So I can do it now, but I was, I was waiting. Okay. Of course. All right. I mean we could go through them together really quick if you want. I mean, it may take the rest of the call. No, I mean, I can do them. I, I was thinking about what we might need to show on Wednesday. So we need to show copies of the observations. We'll need to show like maybe the 3016-90s. So the observations on 36 and 90s are good. So is there any dashboard that you're comfortable kind of showing yet to the gms? I mean we could show them pretty much everything here. I think the, the, this, the 369 dashboard is fine. Yes. I still may need to go back through and make some changes like these. I haven't done these yet, but I'll have that ready by, by Wednesday. I think this dashboard is fine because I don't think any gym is going to look at the numbers and be like, oh, that's incorrect. Right. Just the idea behind the dashboard. So I think this is fine to show them. Which ones are changing and not the performance is changing. 3060 dashboard. Yeah. Oh, hold on. Round one. I should put those menus over there too. So onboarding satisfaction. We're going to keep the percentage here. The last time we discussed, these are going to change to 10 same. So we're not editing any of the 30, 60, 91 so the actual, the actual onboarding satisfaction is 3.8 out of 10. No, because remember the. This measurement first was 1 to 5. I believe we had changed three questions. We change. I don't remember the specific question, but I remember was question 8, 9 and then on the 90 day we change question 6 also. 6, 8, 9 and 10. I believe so, yeah. So just like the observation where we have to go back in and make those five, ten, those threes five or however we want to do it, we may have to do the same thing. Also one of the questions I think is the confidence. It was more on a. I don't think it was on a number scale. It was maybe in the back end I was, I was. It was saving as number but it was. Or the feedback. I think it was the feedback. It was positive, negative, whatever. And we also change it too. So now it's looking for a number and it's not looking for that word. I think it was the feedback. So we got to find that one. And I believe it was this one, if I'm not mistaken. Or are this one. I gotta look at it again. Or maybe this one is the same. Because we're going to change the performance observations. But we weren't. We didn't have a plan to change the 30, 60 90s. No, no, we did not. So but I think most of these will stay the same. Hold on. So the question that we changed. Let me just actually go back to them real quick so I could understand. So for the 30 and 60, we change confident retention. No, we did 10 too. Right. Our 10 was already like that. So. So that's perfect. So now we just got to go back sa and see what the old database had and I could probably do those too. But we just got to go back in now and see what the old database had because a 10 would be a 5, a 3 would be not. Yeah, a 5 would be a 10, a 3 would be a 5. Right. So if we look at the back end for some of these 36 to 90, then it's going to have scoring from 1 to 5 when it should be from 1 to 10. So we got to make those changes. So the dashboard is going to show. Is always going to show. Why do I keep going to observation? The dashboard is always going to show out of five. So like the performance is one, the confidence is one and the retention. Right. Because these were initially one to five. So it's doing it out of five, it needs to do it out of ten and this is probably up to eight because we probably have had some new scores. Our new survey with, with the 1 to 10 scale. So it's, it's the numbers up there a little bit more. But we still need to go in and make some changes to the old ones. And I can bet if I look at, if I look at the database, it's probably saying the same thing. So if I go to the 369 database, so I could just look at the date. But yeah, so you're gonna have 5 and 10. So all these looks like they're new. Everything in August. And then. Hold on. Oh, so we only have 13. Okay. I also can't get to the completed surveys to edit them. I can't figure out how to get to those. I don't think. I don't perform the observations or the 30, 16, 90. I don't think I had an edit option for the 36 to 90. Did I create. I don't remember if I created one. I know I created an edit option for the observation. Where can I go to the old observations to edit them? Not the old one. Well, so if you go to. If you go to observation here and you open, say like this person. If you open it right, and you scroll to the bottom, there's an edit option here. Okay, got it. No problem. But read the email so you understand, because the one that says not measurable is really observed, unless on the. In the database, it's not measurable, if that makes sense. A little confusing. Oh, okay. Damn. Yeah. Oh, sorry, I was unmuted. I got to the next time. Like, hopefully we don't have to make any more, like, changes like that. But the next time I probably need to, like, download the database, export it to Excel, have it before I go in and do these changes. Just the email. I think you were at it. I don't know why the search name is not coming up. That's weird. Let me close this for a little bit and reopen it. I don't know why my email is acting like this. You're in the old outlook. I never switch. But it never used to act like this because I have so much crap open. You prefer the new one? Okay. This is it right here. Yeah. All right. So you guys got this email, right? Yeah. Okay, so basically, if it's. If it's not measurable, which is going to be 10, you're going to change not measurable to observe. Unless it's marked as NM in the data set, which is the sheet right here. See? Attach. Then keep it as not measurable. And I'll show you what that means in a sec. If it says not observe, we're going to keep it as not observed. If it says observe, we're going to change it to not observe. All right, so let's go through. Let's go through the first one. So I could kind of show you guys what I'm. What I mean. So this Excel sheet is the old database before we Change everyone from 1, 2, 3, NM to observe, not observe, which in the back end is really 10, 0 and NM following? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, sure. Okay. All right. I mean, I understand the changes. I'm just spending more time relating it to the actual observation. All right, so let's, let's. Let's go through that. So if. So this is the new. This is what we want it to be. Right? So this is going to be. Or what is it? What it is now? So this is the new version. So if it's a 10, then it's observe. If it's a 0, then it's not observe. So this is Yegord right now. Or is Yegord. Is Yegord real? Yeah, so let's. Let's do that one together. So I'm gonna. I'm gonna walk through that one with you so you could understand what I'm saying. So it's the one that I have highlighted in. In y. These. Right? So this is. This is the new. This is how we have it now. So this is the old one. So three would be 10, right? Observe. The first one for eboard. So this would be zero. One would also be zero. So these would be not observed. This would be the same. And then this would be N M. Does that make sense? Needs to be observed. Unless it's nm in the sheet. Correct. So, dang, what did she measure from this person? So, but do you guys understand this so far make sense? Yeah. You're gonna go into eboards. Yes. Yeah. All right, so I'm gonna put them side by side. And then. So this is. Come on. Okay, so let's start from the top. So why God? All right, so we're looking at this observation. So let's start with general question number one. Right? So general question number one for why God? Ibor Igor. Got a three, right? So they got a three. So a three back then is converted to a ten. Observe. So this should be. So let's edit real quick. So the first four should be observed. Are you changing it or you want me to change it? Okay, so the first four should be observed, right? So 1, 2, 3, 4, and then the next three should be not observed because 2, we're doing zero. Also like it. We didn't have a. We didn't have a description. It was just 2, 1, 2, or 3. And then NM. We didn't have, like, a description to it. Like observe, not observe. Should it be something on the center? Like, would it lower the scores overall if you made that zero, too? Oh, yeah. You have to have this be a zero, one or a two, right? Huh. So what we're saying. So a two in the old system was like, we kind of saw it, but it needs work. But in the new system, we either observed it or we didn't. Correct. So what do we want group that score to be? Does that go to zero or does that go to observed? Because there is no longer like, oh, it needs work. Right. What do you want to put that under? Do you want to put it under observe or. Or not observe? How many entries do you have so far that would be changed by this? Every single observation. Observation that was done before. It's the ones in front of you, Ray? Yeah. Yeah. Pretty much everything that was done before August, all the observations. So there's only like, what, a dozen in here? Yeah, probably. Yeah. Okay, so it doesn't sound like a change in these scores would be that big of a variable to consider. No, I would say we leave it at zero. What are y' all thinking? I agree with that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So not observed in will not move. Is that correct, Omar? Yeah. So we'll leave these as not. So. Yeah, and that's kind of what I put. Not observe will just stay not observe. So that's what you put in your email. I agree with. Yeah. 1, 2, 3, 4, which is this 1, 2, 3, 4. And then we have 1, 2, 3 that are twos, which is 1, 2, 3. And then if you realize also. So we have the 1, 2, 3, which is twos, but this one, which is general question number we do. So it needs to be observe because it's a three. And then the first. So now we're in the SA role. The first role, roll one is showing three, but it's showing NM here. So that's why I meant by if it's showing NM, just check to make sure it's not actual NM. But if it's a 3, then you move it to observe. Little confusing. And then the second role question is also a three. So it's going to be observe. And then there is a not observe, which is number three, but it's shown as an nm. Oh, that's kind of off. And then number. Hold on, I got confused. Let's go back up. So three. So that's correct. No, this should. So hold on. Now let's see what you guys waited for me. Okay, so three, two, two, three. So roll. So this is three. Two should be not observed. And then roll three. This should be observed. So this is what it looks like. Yeah, but because these are all two back in the days like so unless you want to switch these sa to observe. But yeah, because this would have. These would. Most of these would have been two which would have helped the score because right now this score is 4.7. Being that. Right. Faith, I know I lost you guys like five minutes ago, but that really makes me think now it's just back up, man. Oh, what are we thinking? Can we go to the top really quick? One more? Yeah. So the all of the not observed because in this instance Mia really didn't get to see a lot. No, I guess that's fair. Okay, so scored a 2.5 on their role specific observation out of 10. So this is going to highlight a lot I think in the, in the properties. But this person was being observed. But remember this is based on a three or four scale scoring where back then we were also looking for somewhat incompliant. Right. Oh maybe they have everything on. But I don't know. Well I don't know what they were looking at at that time. But the two would suggest that they are incompliant 90. But something is missing. That's why they got a two. Yeah. So exactly. Right. So like what Omar is saying and one placement really like where we would want to like if the training specialist sees that that's like horrific checking. Right. And I don't know, you know, I know we're going back and forth on like how we measure and how we put non measurable or not, you know, so maybe it doesn't show as bad. But like that's one where you step in, you walk into the back and you're like Jeff, you won't believe what I just saw. Like you need to take care of this right away. So I don't know, you know that's just kind of what I'm what I was thinking there with this. So I don't know because I mean. This two could mean because again these were two. So it's not like they just. Maybe in this one they, they confirmed the room type but they didn't confirm the rate. What's the comment on this? Because I wonder if this came up when Danny had mentioned that all of our observations right now are check in specific. And if this wasn't like granted, I wouldn't have had her fill this out if it wasn't an actual check in. But I wonder if it was disclosed. Anywhere in the comment. But she, but if that happens, Faith, we just put not measurable because then the scoring will ignore that. It won't count that against them. So again, this one might have been just in the early days where we're learning how to fill out still. But as we get further in, right. Like you know, if you, if there's no chance to even score this, it's not fair. Right. We put not measurable here. Right. Omer, this is calculating, this is ignoring not measurable for the calculations at the top, right? Yeah, yeah, it is, it is. So it's. This is scoring out of 19 rather than out of 22 because three were not measurable. Yes. I have to offer my four o'. Clock. So I would say think about this. I mean you guys let me know, I could probably work on most of them. You want to keep it like this. Just train the training specialist on any. Any further that we want to. We want to look at. Yeah, it's not going to help us nor you Omar, as a compliance of this. Right, so. Yeah, I agree. I'll take care of these though, if you, if you consider taking care of the 3060 90s, I'll take care of these. Okay, I understand now. And I wrote down some extra notes for myself. So I'll get these changed today. Okay. There, there. So but based on what I did here, like it's. It should be self explanatory. I mean all the threes will be observed because the threes would equate to 10 in how we're doing it now. Twos and ones would be zero and NM would be NM. There are about three. Three team members or three observation that that is missing. I. I got to look for the database, the backup database that have those three. But other than that, everyone else is there in that Excel sheet. Can you, can you. I gotta drop 4 o'. Clock. Can you do 3 to 4 tomorrow for me and you, Omar? Yes. Yeah, I should be on to number three to four. Let's see. All right. Ray, Faith, you don't have to go to this one that you're about to get the email for. Actually hold on. Can we do four? Actually I could do three to four. I could move this to four. I have a one on one in Cocoa Beach. But yeah, yeah, let's do three to four. Yeah. All right. Yeah. All right. All right. So. Right. Faith, you're about to get this, but you don't need to be at this meeting. This is just me. No more talking about the presentation on Wednesday. Okay. All right, Bye. All right. Good to be sure. Thank you. Cool. Was there anything else that you guys had? It's sa. It's. Good, man. How are you? It's. SA. Hello? Hi. Hi. Are you busy? No, I can. I can listen. What's up? No, I can listen. I'm just typing or finish finishing up a code. About Jul. I've been annoyed all day. And then she. Me too. You what? Did you read Julie's email? No, I haven't checked my email in a little bit. She said there's an update coming for September. As of now, it looks like the 10th. It could slide back to the 24th depending on the rest of development testing. Our next scheduled call. Our next social meeting is the fifth, and I'm sure that won't be enough time to get info put together. Would you like me to look at time this week for us to touch back on the new feature? Yeah. What if it's the same feature that. Do you know that? That's what it is. I mean, that's what she told me. It was just a receipt printed. I mean, it's just where to go to print the receipt. But I. We didn't get into details. I don't think she know those details when I spoke to her a few weeks ago. So I guess it's not that big of a deal. But. Yeah, well, I mean, if you want to set up something. If you want to set up something, I mean, we could. I mean, do you just want to ask her? Do you want to respond to the email and say, all right, thank you, sir? Yeah, when I. Yeah, I'll probably write to it later or once I finish this. But yeah, I could just say I. I believe based on what we discussed, this is not. This doesn't require like major training or something because it's just print. Just a print receipt. The receipt feature being added or something like that. Yeah. So I can reply. You say, I. I believe this one should be fairly easy and doesn't require a. Like an actual whatever since it's just the receipt being added is just how to print the receipt. But I. You guys don't work. You don't. You don't work on their training manual. Right. Because I believe Kathleen has all those information already or all those screenshot. Well, that's part of the problem with Johanna and sa. I mean, I want to say. No. Okay. As part of the problem. And that's something I tried to very tactfully bring up to her on our call last week without saying, like, this before, but I was like, you guys have stuff in way too many places. I think your bigger problem, like, wow, is is that if I need to find something, I can go to two different places to find it, and all 10 of those places may not be updated. I was like, you want to think about the last email you sent? You put in all these locations. Like, you shouldn't be updating things in all those locations. Like, if you have a wow. SharePoint, like, why do you also think you need the documentation? Like, that separate documentation of a book? Like, that's time license. I just don't really understand. Then we have a training, and then our training, like, update. Just the amount of money being spent to, like, keep materials updated for a while, in my opinion, is a little crazy. And it should all live in one place. But no, that's why we wouldn't create a manual for them. This was a whole thing when Victor was here. Because again, it did not. It didn't make sense. Right? Like, hold on. Sorry. I'm getting, like, three different texts based on the thing that I'm working on. Huh. I was just gonna answer them now. Like, I have. I have, like, four emails. Two of them that. Because the way I'm going to reply to it, I'm like, hey, I believe LND has Kathleen from. LND has all these screenshots already if you want to reach out to her. Okay. Yeah. Tell me what the email says. You'Ll be. You want me call you on teams? Yeah. All right, let me do that. Okay. It. Hello? Okay. Oh, that was loud. I'm sorry. I was laughing at my team. Sorry. They're, like, yelling across the hall. Right before I. All right, so this one I need Diane. That I could do later. So this one from Julie. So they sent an email, and of course, you know, she include everyone. Diana, Sheena. I'm currently reviewing the World Loyalty Training Guide and notice that we still have images from Mr. Sums. We need new screenshots from FriendX console to update the guide. Is there a way to. To access FDC for these images? Please let me know. If not, could you or your team assist with the attached document? And then she's like, omar, is this something you want to handle or something you need my team to handle? So it was originally from Joanna. So let me see the attached document. It. I think Valeria has.","📅 **Meeting Overview**: The meeting focused on resolving technical issues related to a new hire, McKenzie, who was not showing up correctly in the system, and discussions around updating the scoring structure on performance observations and surveys.

🎯 **Key Decisions Made**:
- McKenzie's status was corrected, and her profile is now visible.
- The team agreed to maintain a scoring structure where old scores of 2 remain as ""not observed.""
- It was concluded that training materials should be centralized to reduce redundancy and confusion.

📋 **Action Items**:
- Omar to reconstruct a section for deactivated employees and correct McKenzie's status by [Date].
- Omar to correct the observation scores in the database by changing old scoring metrics to new ones by [Date].
- Faith to edit 30-60-90 data to reflect correct scoring using the agreed-upon methodology by [Date].
- Coordination with Julie regarding adding new features to the system; draft response and set up a call if necessary by [Date].
- Review and update training guides with assistance from L&D, contacting Kathleen if needed for necessary screenshots by [Date].

💡 **Important Discussions**:
- Challenges faced due to system layout changes resulting in inactive employee profiles not displaying.
- Issues with edit functionalities on the My Manage Access page for changing employee departments.
- The need to train specialists on new scoring changes and database updates.
- Discussions on centralizing training materials for better access and efficiency.

⚠️ **Risks & Issues**:
- Potential confusion or data integrity issues if scoring changes are not implemented correctly across all observations.
- Delay in system updates affecting employee management functionality.
- Overlapping and outdated training resources leading to potential errors and inefficiencies.

📅 **Next Meeting/Follow-up**:
- Omar and team to reconvene on [Next Date] to review dashboard updates and ensure all observation data corrections are complete.
- Preparation for upcoming presentation on Wednesday; ensure all necessary updates and edits are finalized. 

This summary encapsulates the critical points from the meeting, focusing on decisions made, actions to be taken, and any pressing issues that need addressing.","[{""title"": ""Recreate section for deactivated employees"", ""dueDate"": null, ""assignee"": null, ""category"": ""development"", ""priority"": ""high"", ""description"": ""Separate deactivated employees into a new section or filter in management system and ensure inactive employees are accurately represented.""}, {""title"": ""Troubleshoot Mackenzie's profile issue"", ""dueDate"": null, ""assignee"": null, ""category"": ""development"", ""priority"": ""urgent"", ""description"": ""Investigate and resolve issue with accessing Mackenzie's profile in the system which shows her as deactivated since 7/21.

She created a new hire. Her name is McKenzie, but we're not seeing her. So I don't know if you see her somewhere in your back end data. And I have her employee ID number as well. And when we try to re add her, it's giving us an error message because it's saying she already exists. But we can't see her anywhere. Okay. So let me. We could look at this together. Let me just share my screen so you guys could see the back end. Always love to see the back end. Don't work. I know. All right. Where is this table thingy? Oh, I hear her. I didn't realize. I figured something was on. I think she was in a mood earlier today. So it was just a new hire, a team member that got added. Correct. The CFT is Katie. And the new hire that she added, her name is Mackenzie or Kenzie. Kenzie. I'm not seeing it either. 8551-785517-85517. Yes. Yeah, it's not showing that it's added. But when you attempted to add her. Oh, right here. Oh, there it is. Okay. Damn. They added a lot of people after that. Wow. So she was added frontex Smoky Mountain Friendex agent. She. Why is she inactive? I could not see her on the My Manage access page. Unfortunately, to change that and I'm also having issues on that page. That was my second thing I was going to bring up. I cannot make any edits. I can go to the edit page, but there's no submit button. It doesn't lock it in or save it. But yeah, I don't think I saw her on my Manage. Why is this showing that she's inactive? That's weird. We deactivated her. It looks like on 7 21. Was she already in the system from. From way back? It looks like. And she's deactivated. Maybe you know how on the old. The old platform or the old layout, we could see deactivated team members? Yeah. I wonder if this was one of the tests that we did and we just left it deactivated because you can see deactivated team members now. And it kind of just left there. And we didn't reactivate that team member back. It could be. But it's showing that this team member was deactivated back in 721. It could be a test that we did. Honestly, that did that. So let me. Look at her higher date was July 18th. This team member here. Yeah. Someone def looked like the Deactivated button was hit. And I think back then we had the old. The old layout also. So it's this one. And it did trigger a duplicate, and it was deactivated by this person. Who is this? Okay. All right, so let me set the variable back to one. Can you check? Now she's showing up. I need to. I need to recreate this separate section for deactivated employees. But I'm gonna say this was. She may have touched the deactivated button without realizing back then. Okay. Yeah, I do see her now. Yeah. With progress for 30 days. Okay, I'll have her check and see. That's this one, right, mackenzie? Yes. Yeah, yeah. So that's what happened. I. I believe I'm gonna say on the old one and maybe on this one. You guys remember this one? Jacob? No, I mean, like, you remember this layout, right? Oh, yes. So we have all these deactivated option here. I'm thinking maybe she accidentally. Because that. That's been in there since July something. And maybe she accidentally hit that button without realizing or something, and it just kind of stay there in the back end. But because on the new version or the new layout, the deactivated or not the deactivated are not showing up here like on the old one, because I'm going to separate it and do like a separate page just for deactivated. So it doesn't cloud this up. Or I could probably add it as part of the filters here and just put all employees and then deactivated employees or something like that. So you want to see it here. So that's why. But on the other one, we were able to see deactivated employees on the same. So if I deactivated. And I'll. I'll take it back off. But I. If I deactivated. Kind of don't want to deactivate someone because it's going to show the record in the back end. But when I deactivated someone here, it still shows. It just have like a. A gray. Like a gray. What. What was it? It's like a gray highlighted looking. Yeah, but it still shows. But yeah, so that's. That's what it was. Okay, what was the second thing? The other thing that I had, like I said, in my Manage Access page, I'm specifically trying to change the department that a CFT is in. His name is Asael Gomez. And so when I found his profile, when I clicked Edit, he's just not Guest relations. And if I were to select a department, like, there's no save button on this One. There'S no say. Wow. Okay. I'll take these dogs over. Catastrophic ones. Oh my God. That's funny. There's no save button on the edit page. Okay. All right. Was that, was that the only two things? Yes. Okay. I think any other discussion will probably be all data related. So these are just these little things that the trainers are bringing to me. So. Okay, so far everything is working. As you can see, they're using it. The data's in there, which is good. Pushing for more observations with the trainers and everything. So. Okay. Yeah, no complaints on my end so far. All right, perfect. I did not do my job at all on Wednesday. Oh, unless they did. No. Do you guys want to go through that now? I'm, I'm doing it. I'm starting to look at it on the side right now. Yeah. Okay. I, I didn't know if you wanted to wait because you didn't understand the email or. No, I just didn't. I just didn't do my thought. Okay. Yeah, no, you're right. I was actually. Yeah, I was waiting on the. Yeah, what you said. Okay, so it's good to go. So I can do it now, but I was, I was waiting. Okay. Of course. All right. I mean we could go through them together really quick if you want. I mean it may take the rest of the call. No, I mean, I can do them. I, I was thinking about what we might need to show on Wednesday. So we need to show copies of the observations. We'll need to show like maybe the 3000 1690s. So the observations on 36 90s are good. So is there any dashboard that you're comfortable kind of showing yet to the gms? I mean we could show them pretty much everything here. I think the, the, this, the 369 dashboard is fine. Yes. I still may need to go back through and make some changes like these. I haven't done these yet, but I'll have that ready by, by Wednesday. I think this dashboard is fine because I don't think any gym is going to look at the numbers and be like, oh, that's incorrect. Right. Just the idea behind the dashboard. So I think this is fine to show them. Which ones are changing and not the performance is changing. 3060 dashboard. Yeah. Oh, hold on. Round one. I should put those menus over there too. So onboarding satisfaction. We're going to keep the percentage here. The last time we discussed, these are going to change to 10 same. So we're not editing any of the 30, 60, 91. So the actual, the actual onboarding satisfaction is 3.8 out of 10. No, because remember the. This measurement first was 1 to 5. I believe we had changed three questions. We change. I don't remember the specific question, but I remember was question 8, 9 and then on the 90 day we change question 6 also. 6, 8, 9 and 10. I believe so, yeah. So just like the observation where we have to go back in and make those five, ten, those threes five or however we want to do it, we may have to do the same thing. Also one of the questions I think is the confidence. It was more on a. I don't think it was on a number scale. It was maybe in the back end I was, I was. It was saving as number but it was. Or the feedback. I think it was the feedback. It was positive, negative, whatever. And we also change it too. So now it's looking for a number and it's not looking for that word. I think it was the feedback. So we got to find that one. And I believe it was this one, if I'm not mistaken. Or are this one. I gotta look at it again. Or maybe this one is the same. Because we're going to change the performance observations. But we weren't. We didn't have a plan to change the 30, 60 90s. No, no, we did not. So but I think most of these will stay the same. Hold on. So the question that we changed. Let me just actually go back to them real quick so I could understand. So for the 30 and 60, we change confident retention. No, we did 10 too. Right. Our 10 was already like that. So. So that's perfect. So now we just got to go back sa and see what the old database had. And I could probably do those too. But we just got to go back in now and see what the old database had because a 10 would be a 5, a 3 would be not. Yeah, a 5 would be a 10, a 3 would be a 5. Right. So if we look at the back end for some of these 36 to 90, then it's going to have scoring from 1 to 5 when it should be from 1 to 10. So we got to make those changes. So the dashboard is going to show. Is always going to show. Why do I keep going to observation? The dashboard is always going to show out of five. So like the performance is one, the confidence is one and the retention. Right. Because these were initially one to five. So it's doing it out of five, it needs to do it out of ten and this is probably up to eight because we probably have had some new scores. Our new survey with. With the one to ten scale. So it's. It's the numbers up there a little bit more. But we still need to go in and make some changes to the old ones. And I can bet if I look at. If I look at the database, it's probably saying the same thing. So if I go to the 369 database, so I could just look at the date. But yeah, so you're gonna have 5 and 10. So all these looks like they're new. Everything in August. And then. Hold on. Oh, so we only have 13. Okay. I also can't get to the completed surveys to edit them. I can't figure out how to get to those. I don't think. I don't perform the observations or the 30, 16, 90. I don't think I had an edit option for the 36 to 90. Did I create. I don't remember if I created one. I know I created an edit option for the observation. Where can I go to the old observations to edit them? Not the old one. Well, so if you go to. If you go to observation here and you open, say like this person. If you open it right, and you scroll to the bottom, there's an edit option here. Okay, got it. No problem. But read the email so you understand, because the one that says not measurable is really observed, unless on the. In the database, it's not measurable. If that makes sense. A little confusing. Oh, okay. Damn. Yeah. Oh, sorry, I was unmuted. I got to the next time. Like, hopefully we don't have to make any more, like, changes like that. But the next time I probably need to, like, download the database, export it to Excel, have it before I go in and do these changes. Just the email. I think you were at it. I don't know why the search name is not coming up. That's weird. Let me close this for a little bit and reopen it. I don't know why my email is acting like this. You're in the old outlook. I never switch. But it never used to act like this because I have so much crap open. You prefer the new one? Okay. This is it right here. Yeah. All right. So you guys got this email, right? Yeah. Okay, so basically, if it's. If it's not measurable, which is going to be 10, you're going to change not measurable to observe. Unless it's marked as NM in the data set, which is the sheet right here. See? Attach. Then keep it as not measurable, and I'll show you what that means in a sec. If it says not observe, we're going to keep it as not observed. If it says observe, we're going to change it to not observe. All right, so let's go through. Let's go through the first one. So I could kind of show you guys what I'm. What I mean. So this Excel sheet is the old database before we Change everyone from 1, 2, 3, NM to observe, not observe, which in the back end is really 10, 0, and NM following? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, sure. Okay. All right. I mean, I understand the changes. I'm just spending more time relating it to the actual observation. All right, so let's. Let's. Let's go through that. So if. So this is the new. This is what we want it to be. Right? So this is going to be. Or what is it what it is now? So this is the new version. So if it's a 10, then it's observe. If it's a 0, then it's not observe. So this is Yegord right now. Or is Yegord. Is Yegord real? Yeah, so let's. Let's do that one together. So I'm gonna. I'm gonna walk through that one with you so you could understand what I'm saying. So it's the one that I have highlighted in. In y. These. Right? So this is. This is the new. This is how we have it now. So this is the old one. So three would be 10, right? Observe. The first one for eboard. So this would be zero. One would also be zero. So these would be not observed. This would be the same. And then this would be N M. Does that make sense? Needs to be observed. Unless it's nm in the sheet. Correct. So, dang, what did she measure from this person? So, but do you guys understand this so far? Make sense? Yeah. You're gonna go into eboards. Yes. Yeah. All right, so I'm gonna put them side by side. And then. So this is. Come on. Okay, so let's start from the top. So why God? All right, so we're looking at this observation. So let's start with general question number one. Right? So general question number one for why God? Ibor Igor. Got a three, right? So they got a three. So a three back then is converted to a ten. Observe. So this should be. So let's edit real quick. So the first four should be observed. Are you changing it or you want me to change it? Okay, so the first four should be observed, right? So 1, 2, 3, 4, and then the next three should be not observed because 2, we're doing zero also like it. We didn't have a. We didn't have a description. It was just 2, 1, 2, or 3 and then NM. We didn't have, like, a description to it. Like observe, not observe. Should it be something on the center? Like, would it lower the scores overall if you made that zero, too? Oh, yeah. You have to have this be a 0, 1 or a 2, right? Huh. So what we're saying. So a 2 in the old system was like, we kind of saw it, but it needs work. But in the new system, we either observed it or we didn't. Correct. So what do we want group that score to be? Does that go to zero or does that go to observed? Because there is no longer like, oh, it needs work. Right. What do you want to put that under? Do you want to put it under observe or. Or not observe? How many entries do you have so far that would be changed by this? Every single observation. Observation that was done before. It's the ones in front of you, Ray? Yeah. Yeah. Pretty much everything that was done before August, all the observations. So there's only like, what, a dozen in here? Yeah, probably. Yeah. Okay, so it doesn't sound like a change in these scores would be that big of a variable to consider. No, I would say we leave it at zero. What are y' all thinking? I agree with that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So not observed in will not move. Is that correct, Omar? Yeah. So we'll leave these as not. So. Yeah, and that's kind of what I put. Not observe. Will just stay not observe. So that's what you put in your email. I agree with. Yeah. 1, 2, 3, 4, which is this 1, 2, 3, 4. And then we have 1, 2, 3 that are twos, which is 1, 2, 3. And then if you realize also. So we have the 1, 2, 3, which is twos, but this one, which is general question number we do. So it needs to be observe because it's a three, and then the first. So now we're in the SA role. The first role, roll one, is showing three, but it's showing NM here. So that's why I meant by if it's showing NM, just check to make sure it's not actual NM. But if it's a 3, then you move it to observe. Little confusing. And then the second role question is also a three. So it's going to be observe. And then there is a not observe, which is number three, but it's shown as an nm. Oh, that's kind of off. And then number. Hold on, I got confused. Let's go back up. So three. So that's correct. No, this should. So hold on. Now let's see what you guys waited for me. Okay, so three, two, two, three. So roll. So this is three. Two should be not observed. And then roll three. This should be observed. So this is what it looks like. Yeah, but because these are all two back in the days like so unless you want to switch these sa to observe. But yeah, because this would have. These would. Most of these would have been two which would have helped the score because right now this score is 4.7. Being that. Right. Faith, I know I lost you guys like five minutes ago, but that really makes me think now it's just back up, man. Oh, what are we thinking? Can we go to the top really quick? One more? Yeah. So the all of the not observed because in this instance Mia really didn't get to see a lot. No, I guess that's fair. Okay, so scored a 2.5 on their role specific observation out of 10. So this is going to highlight a lot I think in the, in the properties. But this person was being observed. But remember this is based on a three or four scale scoring where back then we were also looking for somewhat incompliant. Right. Oh maybe they have everything on. But I don't know. Well I don't know what they were looking at at that time. But the two would suggest that they are incompliant 90. But something is missing. That's why they got a two. Yeah. So exactly. Right. So like what Omar is saying and one placement really like where we would want to like if the training specialist sees that that's like horrific checking. Right. And I don't know, you know, I know we're going back and forth on like how we measure and how we put non measurable or not, you know, so maybe it doesn't show as bad but like that's one where you step in, you walk into the back and you're like Jeff, you won't believe what I just saw. Like you need to take care of this right away. So I don't know. You know, that's just kind of what I'm what I was thinking there with this. So I don't know because I mean. This two could mean because again these were two. So it's not like they just. Maybe in this one they, they confirmed the room type but they didn't confirm the rate. What's the comment on this? Because I wonder if this Came up when Danny had mentioned that all of our observations right now are check in specific. And if this wasn't like granted I wouldn't have had her fill this out if it wasn't an actual check in. But I wonder if it was disclosed. Anywhere in the comment. But she, but if that happens, Faith, we just put not measurable because then the scoring will ignore that. It won't count that against them. So again this one might have been just in the early days where we're learning how to fill out still. But as we get further in, right. Like you know, if you, if there's no chance to even score this, it's not fair. Right. We put not measurable here. Right. Omer, this is calculating, this is ignoring not measurable for the calculations at the top, right? Yeah, yeah it is, it is. So it's. This is scoring out of 19 rather than out of 22 because three were not measurable. Yes. I have to offer my four o'. Clock. So I would say think about this. I mean you guys let me know, I could probably work on most of them. You want to keep it like this. Just train the training specialist on any. Any further that we want to. We want to look at. Yeah, it's not going to help us nor you Omar, as a compliance of this. Right, so. Yeah, I agree. I'll take care of these though if you, if you consider taking care of the 3060 90s, I'll take care of these. Okay, I understand now. And I wrote down some extra notes for myself so I'll get these changed today. Okay. There, there. So but based on what I did here, like it's. It should be self explanatory. I mean all the threes will be observed because the threes would equate to 10 in how we're doing it now. Twos and ones would be zero and NM would be NM. There are about three. Three team members or three observation that that is missing. I. I got to look for the database, the backup database that have those three. But other than that everyone else is there in that Excel sheet. Can you, can you. I gotta drop 4 o'. Clock. Can you do 3 to 4 tomorrow for me and you, Omar? Yes. Yeah, I should be on to number three to four. Let's see. All right, Ray, Faith, you don't have to go to this one that you're about to get the email for. Actually hold on. Can we do four? Actually I could do three to four. I could move this to four. I have a one on one in Cocoa beach, but yeah. Yeah. Let's do three to four. Yeah. All right. Yeah. All right. All right. So. Right, you're about to get this. But you don't need to be at this meeting. This is just me. No more talking about the presentation on Wednesday. Okay. All right, bye. All right. Good to be sure. Thank you. Cool. Was there anything else that you guys had? It's sa. It's. Good, man. How are you? It's. It's sa. Hello? Hi. Hi. Are you busy? No, I can. I can listen. What's up? No, I can listen. I'm just typing or finish finishing up a code. About Jul. I've been annoyed all day. And then she. Me too. You what? Did you read Julie's email? No, I haven't checked my email in a little bit. She said there's an update coming for September. As of now, it looks like the 10th. It could slide back to the 24th depending on the rest of development testing. Our next scheduled call. Our next social meeting is the fifth. And I'm sure that won't be enough time to get info put together. Would you like me to look at time this week for us to touch back on the new feature? Yeah. What if it's the same feature that. Do you know that? That's what it is. I mean, that's what she told me. It was just a receipt printed. I mean, it's just where to go to print the receipt. But I. We didn't get into details. I don't think she know those details when I spoke to her a few weeks ago. So I guess it's not that big of a deal. But. Yeah, well, I mean, if you want to set up something. If you want to set up something, I mean, we could. I mean, do you just want to ask her? Do you want to respond to the email and say, all right, thank you, sir? Yeah, when I. Yeah, I'll probably write to it later or once I finish this. But yeah, I could just say I. I believe based on what we discussed, this is not. This doesn't require like major training or something because it's just print. Just a print receipt. The receipt feature being added or something like that. Yeah. So I can reply. You say, I. I believe this one should be fairly easy and doesn't require a. Like an actual whatever since it's just the receipt being added is just how to print the receipt. But I. You guys don't work. You don't. You don't work on their training manual. Right. Because I believe Kathleen has all those information already or all those screenshot well. That'S part of the problem with Johanna and sa. I mean, I want to say. No. Okay. As part of the problem with Johanna. And that's something I tried to very tactfully bring up to her on our call last week without saying, like, this before, but I was like, you guys have stuff in way too many places. I think your bigger problem, like, wow is is that if I need to find something, I can go to two different places to find it, and all 10 of those places may not be updated. I was like, you want to think about the last email you sent? You put in all these locations. Like, you shouldn't be updating things in all those locations. Like, if you have a wow. SharePoint, like, why do you also think you need the documentation? Like, that separate documentation of a book? Like, that's time license. I just don't really understand. Then we have a training, and then our training, like, update. Just the amount of money being spent to, like, keep materials updated for a while, in my opinion, is a little crazy. And it should all live in one place. But no, that's why we wouldn't create a manual for them. This was a whole thing when Victor was here. Because again, it did not. It didn't make sense. Right? Like, hold on. Sorry. I'm getting, like, three different texts based on the thing that I'm working on. Huh. I was just gonna answer them now. Like, I have. I have, like, four emails. Two of them that. Because the way I'm going to reply to it, I'm like, hey, I believe LND has Kathleen from LND has all these screenshots already if you want to reach out to her. Okay. Yeah. Tell me what the email says. You'Ll be. You want me call you on teams? Yeah. All right, let me do that. Okay. It. Hello? Okay. Oh, that was loud. I'm sorry. I was laughing at my team. Sorry. They're, like, yelling across the hall. Right before I. All right, so this one I need Diane. That I could do later. So this one from Julie. So they sent an email, and of course, you know, she include everyone. Diana, Sheena. I'm currently reviewing the World Loyalty Training Guide and notice that we still have images from Mr. Sums. We need new screenshots from FriendX console to update the guide. Is there a way to. To access FDC for these images? Please let me know. If not, could you or your team assist with the attached document? And then she's like, omar, is this something you want to handle or something you need my team to handle? So it was originally from Joanna. So let me see the attached document. It. I think Valeria has.","📅 **Meeting Overview**: The meeting primarily focused on addressing employee system issues, specifically regarding the visibility and activation status of a new employee, Mackenzie. Additionally, there were discussions on historical observation data accuracy and upcoming presentation preparations.

🎯 **Key Decisions Made**:
- McKenzie's system profile was identified and reactivated.
- It was decided to update and correct historical observation assessments to align with new evaluation standards.
- The approach for Wednesday's presentation was agreed upon, including which dashboard metrics to display.

📋 **Action Items**:
- Omar will recreate a separate section for deactivated employees by next week.
- Omar and another team member will address the missing 'submit' button issue on the Manage Access page by the next meeting.
- An internal database update will be executed to adjust previous observation data measurements to fit the new scale by the next day.
- Omar will take charge of updating the performance dashboards, ensuring they're ready for presentation on Wednesday.

💡 **Important Discussions**:
- The confusion regarding McKenzie's inactive status was clarified; she was mistakenly deactivated during a previous test on the old system.
- Concerns about the unavailability of a 'submit' button on the Manage Access page were raised and noted for a fix.
- Detailed scrutiny of previous role observations was conducted to determine appropriate data conversion from old to new metrics.
- Upcoming presentation content was deliberated; the focus will be on the 30, 60, 90-day dashboard metrics.

⚠️ **Risks & Issues**:
- Potential errors in historical employee observations due to data scale discrepancies.
- Missing functional components (like the submit button) could inhibit user capability on the Manage Access page.

📅 **Next Meeting/Follow-up**:
- The next meeting is scheduled for tomorrow from 3-4 PM to further discuss and finalize presentation preparations.
- Prepare to address any system update requirements following the upcoming feature release in the September update.","[{""title"": ""Resolve Mackenzie employee ID issue"", ""dueDate"": null, ""assignee"": ""unassigned"", ""category"": ""development"", ""priority"": ""urgent"", ""description"": ""Investigate and correct the issue where Mackenzie cannot be re-added due to a duplicate entry, ensuring her status is active and visible on the Manage Access page.""}, {""title"": ""Recreate separate section for deactivated employees"", ""dueDate"": null, ""assignee"": ""unassigned"", ""category"": ""development"", ""priority"": ""high"", ""description"": ""Develop a feature in the system to view deactivated employees separately to avoid clutter on the main employee management page.""}, {""title"": ""Fix save button on Manage Access edit page"", ""dueDate"": null, ""assignee"": ""unassigned"", ""category"": ""development"", ""priority"": ""high"", ""description"": ""Resolve the issue where there is no save button on the Manage Access page when changing department information.""}, {""title"": ""Prepare 30/60/90 dashboard for presentation"", ""dueDate"": ""2023-09-06"", ""assignee"": null, ""category"": ""development"", ""priority"": ""high"", ""description"": ""Ensure the 30/60/90 performance dashboard is ready and accurate for the presentation to management.

Does that make sense? Like so in talent acquisition, you're not supposed to do that. Every wreck should be a new wreck so that you have historical data on those, but it's not. Golf cart attendant is one wreck and everyone is hired into that one wreck. I see, I see. So it's always the wreck always gonna be. Yeah, right. You see what I'm saying? Yeah. But it shouldn't be like that. You should be able to see that. I had five golf cart attendant wrecks and this is the history of all of those wrecks. That's really how it should work. And Trisha's been trying to get that changed for a while, but I don't think our systems would allow us to do that or something. And so that's what's happening is that when they're asking them to open that position, if it's somebody, it's up here, it's up here. Vi says all of their information is up here. They don't write anything down. Oh. But that really speaks to some of the things that Westgate. That's the problem in TA is that because they turn over those team, those recruiters so often, somebody just wouldn't know and they would just back for the wreck. That's what's happening. So Trish is going to have to figure out a way to get that. Like. Yeah, I don't know what she's going to be able to do there, but. Okay. Okay. So. So we're good with those three checklists I'm sending them. I was just going through them in the, in the LMS to make sure that they were built properly. And so we're good with those three titles. So Guest Relations, Guest Experience and Resort Services Operator. Hold on, what was the second one? Guess. Guest gem. Oh, Jim. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes. Okay. Golf cart and Bell Staff. We're gonna leave it how it is for now. As in. As in we're not turning them on. We'Re not putting them, we're not separating them. Okay. Oh, we're not separating. Right. We're gonna leave it how it is. Bell services for now. There's. There's equally the same pros and cons with separating them and keeping them together. Spoke to pretty much everyone again from the gyms that would be affected, the department leaders that would be affected, hr. And. I mean the pros and cons, we're looking at more of a elevated department. Right. And if we bring in team members that are more guest facing, then it will elevate the department a little bit more. However, the plan, if we keep it. So we're just going to keep it would be. And that's one of the conversation I had with HR this morning. How does. How do we promote this position? Right. Because it's a. It's like a multi job position. How do we promote it? And then when we hire someone for the field and that would be up to me. How do we. How do we decide who goes where? Right. So what we've came up with was that when we hire someone, the position is going to be post as best services and then it's going to say like golf cart duties and then bell services, bell staff or something like that. Right. And the description will be for golf cart. So that's kind of what we discussed this morning. And so we still want to hire them to do that specific area, whether it's golf cart or bell staff. However, their training is going to be everything together right now. If they're in bell staff because that's what they're hired for and they. And we need help in golf cart, then they'll go to. Then they'll help. Right. So that's. That's kind of how we're approaching it. Okay. So is the thought that we want to then combine the two checklists into one. Yes. And figure out where there's overlap and do we want to do this now? So it's just sitting there ready, waiting to go or are we going to wait until we see the na actually hit and they. And then discuss how. How that impacts the checklist? Because this is the one where we can really use. Yes, this is the one we could. Really use any on this one. So did we. Did we tell you that it got moved from 2026 to scoops instead of. It's gonna be in Q4 of 2025. Things just told. Could be December, could be November. Yeah. Should we hold off? Because right now I rewrote it as if there was no N A. So I pulled out anything that was specific to golf cart because of the. The properties that don't have golf carts. Yeah, but how would the properties with golf cart operate? Because it's general enough that says. So that was that. Was that because they're very. The properties with golf cart. The golf cart trainings are very specific. So all I changed was I pulled out the two lines about golf cart training that were on day two. And it just says complete any additional CP training, practical exams and practice as required by your property. Okay. So that it just doesn't so it would. You'd have to keep with whatever record keeping you currently for the practical exam you wouldn't be able to use the lms. What about further down on that checklist where it goes over? There's two different other items. The Learn golf cart inspection, cleaning and maintenance. Learn out of service golf cart ticket. Those are all actually hot sauce items. When I spoke to Shane, he said that all those items except for like the, the cleaning and maintenance part, but the tickets, the sign out procedure, the check in procedure, all that are hot sauce items. So I was shoving them under there. Not completely. Okay, so the lakes for. For inspection and all those. Yes. For, for the lakes they use a different program to sign out. They have like a golf cart program that they use to sign out. But for the inspection and all that everyone use between the villas and the lakes they do use hot sauce. But for signing and signing out golf card, they use a different program at the lakes. Okay. And I think we had put like other. Our programs or something like that there. I don't remember. Any golf cart. I had shoved them all under hot sauce so that I can, I can pull them back out. And then. So then do we want to reinstate everything as it. As it was before and then just wait for the N.A. put any golf cart items that were on the golf cart attendant checklist that weren't already on bell services. I just, I feel like once we get the NA you may have to go back in. Right. That's why I'm like. And just kind of readjust. Four months. They didn't say. The problem is, is that they didn't say when in Q4. So I mean we're a month from Q4. Right. But. Right, Ari? Yeah. Yeah, pretty much. I mean who's Ryan Gaines? I have no idea. Westgate person. Yeah, he's. Email me me about Tablo Access. I don't. Table access. Rental revenue from Westgate. Grand Central from New York. Ryan Gaines. Oh, I know. Yes. At this rate, are we getting that Checklist out on 91? No. No. So at this rate, I don't mind. There's a possibility with the 10 one. I don't know if that's even on a work day, but the 101 release. We could ask Belinda on our next call. Like where is this at in Q4? I would just wait to be honest because you're. I don't want to, but that's just going to be double world. Okay, so let's go over it again. Once we know the NA Is. Yeah. Are just Created now with NA in mind. So once we get the na, you don't have to worry about, like, recreating anything and combining it. Hopefully. Hopefully. And combining it will kind of make it easier for you too. I mean, it's kind of one checklist like that, Dex, on the computer screen. I don't know who drew that. That's pretty cool. Okay, so I'll leave that. I'll just put a tickler thing in the file to revisit the checklists on 10.1 and find out where we are with the NA feature and how the jobs have all spun out. And can we all agree on. Yeah, that belongs to the checklist. Yeah. All right, so I think that's it about checklists. Okay. The only thing we were just. I was just mentioning to Adam is that it looks like all the job change profiles also include the Resort Ops Day 1 checklist. And they should not. Right. Say that again. The profiles that we use to assign courses for job change, because we have to assign them to new hires one way and job changes to the other. The job change ones include the Resort Ops Day 1 checklist. Now, if you're changing jobs, should you have done everything that's in that Resort Ops day one already and that you don't need that checklist again? So you're going from corporate to resort op. Okay, so then there's going to be overlap there, though, because in the corporate security and the one. The day one for corporate that Chris and I did like that I started. And security, it's basically the same thing. If you have adp, stuff like that, like the majority of it's the same. Yeah. Like instead of meeting gm, it's like meeting your department leadership. Instead of property tour, it's like building. Tour. Stuff like that. Throwing it out there because they would need those things. But. Nothing can ever. I mean, we could go back all of those. Well, it's a whole. It's a whole separate course that they have to do. So I feel like you would want to just remove it if you're not. If there's anything to sign it if you're transferring. Like, if I'm a resort, let's say I'm on Omar's team, but then I go to like housekeeping. Is there a way to. It's only going to understand that the. That tiling is going to not stuff that they're coming from. Yeah. So if you're going from resort to. Resort, it's a duplicate. I would just say leave it off. Okay. So that. That's A change that has to be then made to all the existing profiles. So do you want to change it? What do you mean? So if I go in already, I probably shouldn't have brought this up. Today feels like a Friday and it's only Tuesday so probably not. So if I look at job teams. So here's characters and if I go over here because this is such a stupid thing. Sorry. So I'm changing jobs. I do the welcome to Resort Ops and the animated character performance checklist. So do we still want them to do welcome to Resort Operations? It's built into every job change profile. So KP would have to go in and delete them all. Can you just turn them off? She can, she can delete. She'd have to delete out that class. She can't turn it. She would want us to leave it running. But she'd just have to delete that class. It's not a big deal to delete the one class but I just didn't want to. I just noticed it today when I was, when I was fixing the ones when I was sending her the information for Omar and I was like ah crap. Can we just ask, can we bringing this back up and bring it up with Alex. Okay. I just don't want to make decisions about reserve ops without him. Okay. Moving on. Quick hit things. The well loyalty screenshots. All good. Did you want. All good. Okay. So you're good. You're going to send them to Joanna? Already did. Spoke to her this morning. Who pays what is is still uncharged to go out. So I think you wanted to launch it the 28th. Yes. So the reason for that is I have my meeting on the 20th, my front office national meeting on the 29th. Okay. So I just want to show it to them real quick and show it to them there at the meeting. Okay. Yeah, we did. We did decide to trial a survey on the end of it. So there will be one extra thing. So it's going to be the elearning the chart and then just a five question survey and it's just a tiny experiment and then we'll figure out strategy going forward for how we would want to if we want to scale it. Okay. So that's that. Yeah. I realized I did not have a clue what you guys were talking about the other day. That's right. I did kind of grab you as you were walking down the hall. I was really mad at that point too. I did talk to Alex a bit. Got his perspective. His is a little different. We talked a little bit about it. Okay, so we'll make sense. Scale it off every time. Water park at some ridiculous hour of the morning. I sent you to water park. I saw that. I'm look at the head but I'm. Like these are going out yesterday bled into today. But what do you call. So I don't know if you want to go over those or if there was other stuff that. That that's all that I had because needs to get out the door. So. So, so I can move on to the other stuff if you wanted to go over those or if you wanted. If there was other stuff that you had on your agenda. No, I think that was it. Did Julie respond and say that that's what the meeting is about? Oh, I was going to say that Friday at 2:00'. Clock. Yeah. What was she thinking? Wait, she said that meeting at 2 o'? Clock? Yes. I didn't see that I was Friday. Of a holiday weekend. What was, what was the reply from her though? Did she say I don't think any. Of them are on the email because. When I originally Elite. Hold on. Responded to her, took everybody off. Am I yes to this or not? Oh, she just said sounds good, I'll get something on the calendar. So she didn't really answer if it's the. I'm gonna go into the holiday weekend. Pissed off. If it's the release. But if it's the receipt, I'm sure it's a receipt release. And okay. Honestly I don't think you need to put anything together for that. Okay. Okay. Okay, cool. It's. And if you do, it's something really simple. Okay. Where to go, where to click print. Okay. I saw the one for. I figured out where the one was for for folios. So when I saw. It's just because kind of you hit the little three dots and yeah. You hit receipt. And I mean if it's, if it's. It's for the 50 hold or the hold whole. I'm assuming it would be somewhere under the whole section. Right. I mean that would probably be the best place to put it. So I don't, I don't see a lot of training needed for that. Okay. It seems like it's just an email and it's just gonna hound yeah you or me until something. So she has proof that they were. I'll just send out normally send out that email. They were informed. So that was the only other thing that I had. And then yeah, it's just water park. So I did. Did front desk agent and I did front Desk managers first. The front desk managers would take the front desk agent course and the front end. The front desk manager course. The front desk manager will take the frontex agent course for. For water park. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. And then water park team members would just take their own, except for Smoky Mountain, who would have them take front desk agent and water park team members since they're going to be the ones issuing the. Yes. And I do think it's not necessary, but I do think the water park should take the water park, even though they're not going to be doing anything. Oh, the smoky water. The smoky water part. Because eventually. Okay, we may get them their own tablets and have them. Actually, they. I think they still need to take it as. Because if someone comes and say, hey, I didn't get, you know, fans or whatever, rather than coming back to the front decks, I would like for them to look it up right there rather than sending them back to the front decks. Okay. So you're going to equip them to be able to do that. Okay. I need to check in with River Ranch and the lakes. Well, I need to check in with Michelle to see if the water park. If the lakes and River Ranch have got their access yet and their devices. That's kind of her job. And if the. The link you send, if it's the Cook reference guide that you had and you just kind of put it there. I mean, I'm sure it's. I'm sure it's good to go. I jazzed it up a little bit. I gave it. I gave it a quiz at the end. Okay. So, yeah, I mean, it's all the same material, so it should be. It should be good. I'm trying to think if there was anything. Is it interactive or just. I started them out. It's not super interactive. I mean, there's some tabs and things that they can click on. There's a drag and drop. Okay. Some flip cards. I try to start out most of the lessons with a question and try and let them puzzle it out on their own first or take a guess at least, as opposed to just. Here's all the information. Right. So, you know, kind of that. More of that discovery type mindset as opposed to what you call. And it's set up just like. Just. It's in the same 360. It's kind of same idea as Megan's that you can make comments on. On the screens. So. Okay, cool. Anything. I'm gonna go through it because I was a little delirious here, so I know there's a typo or two that I couldn't find and I'm like, I don't care, they're going out anyway. That's right. So I'll just, I'll just go give it one more pass through and make sure. There was nothing that I was a little iffy on the wording. Okay. For that. And I know we never. You still haven't heard about the idea of that it doesn't matter if they're staying on their, their, their usage. So I was intentionally vague to kind of leave that. Yeah, yeah, I, yeah, I wouldn't get into that too much. They're just going to follow their current procedure and the current procedure right now if a owner that books outside of their week, outside of their account, if they can prove that they're an owner, we're still giving them the benefit. So if they book through Expedia Hotels.com we're still giving them all the benefits. If they can show, hey, I'm an owner with their phone or whatever, their, some of them still have their old card, we still give them the owner's benefit. Okay. Now just thinking of this, I know right now we're really focused on existing team members, but going forward, this will be something we can include in the whole new hire. We can add that whole onboarding thing the same way we're adding who pays. What is there going to be besides this, Are they going to get an introduction to water park policy in some other way or do we need to add any kind of policy information into this? We didn't add anything for the Frontex agent for water park. Right. This kind of came up after the checklist for water park. It says, it says it on, it just says the, like the day. It has like all the tabs. So I think the voucher tab is slash Water park is one of the checklist items. So it doesn't have any sub bullets. Or anything to explain it. No, but what you just said, Yes, I would love for it to be included, whatever, wherever it's going to be placed on the checklist. So when you get to it, that's going to be the lesson. Okay. Right. Yeah. And I think maybe that's the next step too is to start looking at some of these checklist items and turn them into E Learning. Okay. Yeah, absolutely. So, but, so is there anything I need to. So when you're, when you're going through the course, are there any policies and procedures related to water park that I need to add to the course that would that would benefit a new hire. So just to keep that in mind. You have to think about that. Let me ask Michelle too. I can't think of any, you know, most of the stuff that I'm thinking of, it's really specific to the water park, like entrance capacity in terms of how many people. Those are just stuff that the water park team members need to know for front decks. Not really, but I'll, I'll, I'll talk to her, Michelle, and see if there's anything. But I really can't think of anything really. And then in terms of assignments, should this also get assigned to resort services operators? The water park? Yes, because they may get a call that says, hey, and they, you know, the guest doesn't know who they're talking to. They dial zero. They think they're talking to the front desk when it's resort services. So they're like, hey, I checked in and can you check how many water park pass I have left or something? So at least they'll know how to check it in reserve services. So yeah. Okay. And they can't add anything the water park? Yeah, they can't. They wouldn't be able to add. You're not giving them any positions to add entries. Any permissions. Who did I give access from that? I think the managers does have access. I think. Think so. Okay, so we should add then the managers also to take the manager class and the front desk agent class. From resource services. Yes. Okay. Yeah, I think it's the manager. Did I add the supervisors? I think it's just the managers. And then what about guest relations? Do they need any access or do. They need any water? Oh, they do. They definitely do. And the same thing is it's split between guest relations agent and manager. Yes, because so in guest relations I just added the access recently, every single guest relations team member has access at the villas to override. Okay. Why? Because whenever sales have a new owner, they go to guest relations to get them access to the water park. So they should. So guest relations, agents and UP should take the. Both the, the agent and the. Yes. I said K's gonna love me when I try to explain how we're gonna. I mean you could just assign everything to all of front decks. Well, I don't want them to use if they're not. If they don't have the power to do something to do override. Tell them to do it. I see what you're saying. Yeah. Because friendx agent. Except Smoli. Otherwise the only one. Yeah. Have access to override do. Okay. So then hold on one second. Let me just. Both agent and manager. Okay. And then Smokey Smoke Weed said to said their water park people should also take the word for team member. Their front desk agents, they still have the same split between managers have to do the override things. Right. Okay. Okay. So they get. They get assigned same thing. They just also get the water park. Yeah. One to be able to do the issuing point. Correct part. Because it, it should be like the permission should be divided by role. Like it should be based on role. So whichever property should still be manager. I think supervisors are not. If I'm not mistaken. I don't remember. Okay. But yeah. Okay. And then I'll reach out to Michelle for the water park team member piece of it. Because I think their titles get all wonky depending on. Oh it's, it's. Yeah. I mean they did the consolidation too like when they were eliminating titles and stuff. And I think honestly I don't know what they're called. I think they're all called guest experience agent. But it, it's a combination of lifeguards. Okay. And they all work different property do it different. Like the lakes, when I was on the call with them going over like what they need. They use all their lifeguards as cashiers. Okay. And lifeguards. And then they rotate them. And so I'm like, so who, who are cashiers? You're like, oh, everyone. Okay. So they all rotate them. So we may have a bigger group to train there because they, they rotate everyone. Okay. Okay. Now we also. We had talked about. So now you still want. We want to try and have everybody go through the E learning first before we deploy any in person training. Ideally last time we. Because then they don't do the. Then they don't do the elearning. Okay. So yeah, that would be ideal. Yeah. So does that work? So I know, I know our date was 9 8. Is that 98 for. For customer. For guests to start entering the water park and everybody be trained by. Or is that 9 8? We want to start training. 9 8. We want to start training. Okay, gotcha. And we'll just give ourselves a week. So. Okay. Which we may not need last time was like two days. So maybe they could start on Friday. And just by looking at. I just got a report right now from the analytics team that does tableau and every single property is actually using the water park feature already. What? Yeah, not well, all the properties that have water park. So. Okay, so for example, like let's see. Smokey issued 16 vouchers in the last week. We don't need no stinking training. Towers. Issued six fillers, issued 154, tungsten 180. Okay, so the feature is there. I mean, the feature is there, right? So I reach out to Kayla. I'm like, hey, are you using it? He's like, honestly, I kind of use it sometimes because it's just there and it's so easy. Okay, but I'm like, kayla, but what. But why would anybody on a non water park property be hitting the issue button? Because that means. That means somebody's handing them a wristband when they hit issue, correct? No, this is just a report showing how many were issued per property, not showing who issued it overall. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So. All right, well, the training should be really quick. At least they like it. Yeah, they're already using it. Do I need to talk to Faith then about having somebody at all these properties? And then if we're doing three properties simultaneously, how do we want. Do we want to prioritize? I know we have. Don't we have someone at. What's her name? Danny and Smokey? Can she do Smokey? I can talk to Fate and then. Just someone at Ranch. Okay, and who's responsible for which resorts? Hold on. Between Mia and. I'll get it wrong. I just know their big property. I never can remember their small properties. Hold on. Isn't that the Summit? The Summit is on the eight, right? Summit. It sure is. We can't do that. Where is it? Is it the Lakes? Is that the Villas? Damn. Should I cancel? I have a way out. I don't have to speak. I'm just kidding. Jared goes before me and then I go and then you. God damn it. It's always something giving you all the facts so you have them before you make a decision. Okay, fine. This is the last year for them. Every freaking year. Invite someone else. We just. We could take the two hours and do it together. It's me. Then you just combine the whole thing in two hours. I could. It's really from a training perspective, it's mainly for an office, so. Yeah. Would have to come up. We can come up with something. Yeah. All right. Sorry. That's okay. That just. The eight didn't put two and two together. It's the rollout day and the wow day. The wow Summit. Fun. Well, Bill, this is. It just. It will impact whoever is attending. I guess that. Wow. Yeah. Summit. Because I was gonna say I could just. I could be at the Lakes that day, but the summit, I mean, I Could come over there after the summit. But I know if Ray's doing it he likes to do the meetings early like he likes to do 9, 10 o'. Clock. But I guess it just depends on who. But we'll definitely need someone at River Ranch and someone at the lakes. Okay. And honestly the, the assistance that they need was really, it was more system related. Not the system messing up but user system assistance. Okay. Yeah. On the water park side or on. The, on the water park side. Okay. I can't log in. How do I like. Yeah, it was, it was mostly most of that that we dealt with. Okay. Yeah. There's definitely a module right at the beginning of the, of the training on how to like your sans account and all that. Yeah. So but they're still, you're still saying that kind of. I was surprised. I mean keeping people. I mean some of those team members, they, they're not that they're not around computers. Yeah. They have a cell phone but they've never linked. They've never had an account. Right. With Westgate. Right. They've never had to log into an email. They've never had to do any of that. I mean I've probably set up three accounts like as new account because they've never had an account, never had an email, nothing. Okay. So. So there, some of them is just going to be very new to logging into a Westgate computer. So that those were probably some of the assistance that they need. Okay. Do you still want to stick with 9899 is there. Is 98 a holiday? Like is 9 is no. 91. Okay. So yeah, I mean I'm good with. I don't know also what the team members schedules look like or anything like that. Let's do 99. That will probably help a little bit better because Morgan is normally off Monday, Tuesday. Sorry Sunday. Monday. So she'll be there on Tuesday. Okay. And I don't know if that's gonna change by then when they make all these changes. Yeah. So we'll do 99. And then for whoever's going to River Ranch is can they get everybody in one day? I have no idea the size of the team or when they're gonna have to spend multiple days going out to River Ranch. I think one day is fine. I met with the team, the front office team is very small and then I met with the water park team when I was out there. Okay. And it's not, it's not a big team. I think one day. I mean everybody else, the other ones are all local. Yeah. And I think we're given 99. I mean, yeah, we're giving them enough time if we send it out today. I'll send out an email to them today, which I think I. Let me talk to Faith first and just confirm that she's got that the trainers are available. Okay. And then I can let you know then. Yeah, but I'm not sending, like, trainers. Name just, like the dates. Right. Okay. I. Well, I had told them 98 two weeks ago. Or I'll send it to Michelle and have Michelle send it out to them. But. Yeah, so we should be good there. Okay. All right. I think that's. I think that's all the questions that I have for Water park at the moment. Okay. So water park. Check this. What. What else was on the agenda for. Your career path thing? I know I said I would do the on demand suggestions for each thing. I added those in. I just need to hyperlink them. Like, review links to the. Okay. Yeah. So like, for Front desk, I did guest service fundamentals. I kind of kept it like 5 or less. I did guest service fundamentals. Handling difficult guest service scenarios and then. Resolving conflicts are good ones. For the advanced Front Desk, I did Time management essentials. It does a guide to workplace integrity. Yes. For cft, Effective feedback strategies. A guide to mentoring others, and then a guide to legal. Perfect. And then Jen is. There's some of her left here because. I know you said they could either go into both or one or the other. Yeah. Business writing fundamentals, Project management fundamentals, and then effective feedback strategies. That's one that overlaps. Yeah. Supervisor, Five leadership styles to influence a team. A leader's guide to resolving team conflict, Motivating your team Performance management essentials, and then leading.","📅 **Meeting Overview**: The meeting revolved around streamlining processes related to talent acquisition, enhancing position management, checklists for various roles, and preparing for upcoming water park operations.

🎯 **Key Decisions Made**:
- Talent Acquisition: Continued use of a single requisition (wreck) for roles like golf cart attendants, but efforts to better track historical recruitment data were discussed.
- Role Checklists: Agreed to combine checklists for Golf Cart and Bell Staff into one to streamline processes, with a revision planned once the N.A. (not applicable) feature is active.
- Agreement to trial a survey following training modules as an experimental strategy.
- Confirmation to include certain training modules in new hire onboarding.

📋 **Action Items**:
- **Trish**: Explore system limitations and potential solutions for better historical tracking of recruitment data.
- **Checklist Team**: Combine the checklists for Golf Cart and Bell Services; revisit checklist updates by 10/01.
- **K.P.**: Adjust job change profiles by removing unnecessary duplication.
- **Training Team**: Prepare e-learning modules for water park operations and customer service by 09/09. Coordinate with Faith on train-the-trainer activities.
- **Michelle**: Confirm water park team titles and responsibilities.

💡 **Important Discussions**:
- The necessity of individualized requisitions for better data tracking in recruitment.
- Benefits and drawbacks of keeping Bell Staff and Golf Cart roles separate versus combined.
- How best to position and promote multi-job positions within HR.
- Exploration of future training strategies and how to seamlessly integrate training with onboarding processes.

⚠️ **Risks & Issues**:
- System limitations hindering desired changes in recruitment processes.
- Potential complications in checklist integrations if delayed N.A. features have heavy dependencies.
- Ensuring new employees are adequately and timely trained given their varied tech competencies.

📅 **Next Meeting/Follow-up**:
- Plan for a follow-up review of checklist updates on 10/01.
- Regular check-ins to monitor progress towards 09/09 training readiness.
- Next internal review to include discussions on talent acquisition system improvements and training module effectiveness.","[{""title"": ""Develop strategy to change handling of job requisitions"", ""dueDate"": null, ""assignee"": ""Trisha"", ""category"": ""development"", ""priority"": ""medium"", ""description"": ""Trisha needs to devise a method to have separate requisitions for each position to maintain historical data in talent acquisition systems.""}, {""title"": ""Send checklists and confirm readiness"", ""dueDate"": null, ""assignee"": null, ""category"": ""meeting"", ""priority"": ""high"", ""description"": ""Confirm that the checklists for Guest Relations, Guest Experience, and Resort Services Operator are set up correctly in the LMS.""}, {""title"": ""Revisit combined checklist itemization"", ""dueDate"": ""2024-10-01"", ""assignee"": null, ""category"": ""review"", ""priority"": ""medium"", ""description"": ""Combine golf cart and bell staff checklists into one, and revisit on 10.1 for NA feature impact.""}, {""title"": ""Delete unnecessary class from job change profiles"", ""dueDate"": null, ""assignee"": ""KP"", ""category"": ""development"", ""priority"": ""medium"", ""description"": ""Remove Resort Ops Day 1 checklist from job change profiles to avoid duplication.""}, {""title"": ""Launch 'Who Pays What' initiative"", ""dueDate"": ""2024-09-28"", ""assignee"": null, ""category"": ""development"", ""priority"": ""high"", ""description"": ""Ensure the 'Who Pays What' learning module is prepared and ready for launch on the 28th to present at the front office national meeting on the 29th.""}, {""title"": ""Coordinate Water Park training"", ""dueDate"": ""2024-09-09"", ""assignee"": ""Faith"", ""category"": ""training"", ""priority"": ""high"", ""description"": ""Organize training for front desk and support staff using the existing courses, and address access and equipment needs at each location.""}, {""title"": ""Check with Michelle regarding device access"", ""dueDate"": null, ""assignee"": null, ""category"": ""development"", ""priority"": ""high"", ""description"": ""Ensure water park team members at River Ranch and the Lakes have necessary access and devices for training.""}, {""title"": ""Rollout checklist conversion to eLearning"", ""dueDate"": null, ""assignee"": null, ""category"": ""development"", ""priority"": ""medium"", ""description"": ""Convert certain checklist items into eLearning modules.

She created a new hire. Her name is McKenzie, but we're not seeing her. So I don't know if you see her somewhere in your back end data. And I have her employee ID number as well. And when we try to re add her, it's giving us an error message because it's saying she already exists. But we can't see her anywhere. Okay. So let me. We could look at this together. Let me just share my screen so you guys could see the back end. Always love to see the back end. Don't work. I know. All right. Where is this table thingy? Oh, I hear her. I didn't realize. I figured something was on. I think she was in a mood earlier today. So it was just a new hire, a team member that got added. Correct. The CFT is Katie. And the new hire that she added, her name is Mackenzie or Kenzie. Kenzie. I'm not seeing it either. 8551-785517-85517. Yes. Yeah, it's not showing that it's added. But when you attempted to add her. Oh, right here. Oh, there it is. Okay. Damn. They added a lot of people after that. Wow. So she was added frontex Smoky Mountain Friendex agent. She. Why is she inactive? I could not see her on the My Manage access page. Unfortunately, to change that and I'm also having issues on that page. That was my second thing I was going to bring up. I cannot make any edits. I can go to the edit page, but there's no submit button. It doesn't lock it in or save it. But yeah, I don't think I saw her on my Manage. Why is this showing that she's inactive? That's weird. We deactivated her. It looks like on 7 21. Was she already in the system from. From way back? It looks like. And she's deactivated. Maybe you know how on the old. The old platform or the old layout, we could see deactivated team members? Yeah. I wonder if this was one of the tests that we did and we just left it deactivated because you can see deactivated team members now. And it kind of just left there. And we didn't reactivate that team member back. It could be. But it's showing that this team member was deactivated back in 721. It could be a test that we did. Honestly, that did that. So let me. Look at her higher date was July 18th. This team member here. Yeah. Someone def looked like the Deactivated button was hit. And I think back then we had the old. The old layout also. So it's this one. And it did trigger a duplicate, and it was deactivated by this person. Who is this? Okay. All right, so let me set the variable back to one. Can you check? Now she's showing up. I need to. I need to recreate this separate section for deactivated employees. But I'm gonna say this was. She may have touched the deactivated button without realizing back then. Okay. Yeah, I do see her now. Yeah. With progress for 30 days. Okay, I'll have her check and see. That's this one, right, mackenzie? Yes. Yeah, yeah. So that's what happened. I. I believe I'm gonna say on the old one and maybe on this one. You guys remember this one? Jacob? No, I mean, like, you remember this layout, right? Oh, yes. So we have all these deactivated option here. I'm thinking maybe she accidentally. Because that. That's been in there since July something. And maybe she accidentally hit that button without realizing or something, and it just kind of stay there in the back end. But because on the new version or the new layout, the deactivated or not the deactivated are not showing up here like on the old one, because I'm going to separate it and do like a separate page just for deactivated. So it doesn't cloud this up. Or I could probably add it as part of the filters here and just put all employees and then deactivated employees or something like that. So you want to see it here. So that's why. But on the other one, we were able to see deactivated employees on the same. So if I deactivated. And I'll. I'll take it back off. But I. If I deactivated. Kind of don't want to deactivate someone because it's going to show the record in the back end. But when I deactivated someone here, it still shows. It just have like a. A gray. Like a gray. What. What was it? It's like a gray highlighted looking. Yeah, but it still shows. But yeah, so that's. That's what it was. Okay, what was the second thing? The other thing that I had, like I said, in my Manage Access page, I'm specifically trying to change the department that a CFT is in. His name is Asael Gomez. And so when I found his profile, when I clicked Edit, he's just not Guest relations. And if I were to select a department, like, there's no save button on this One. There'S no say. Wow. Okay. I'll take these dogs over. Catastrophic ones. Oh my God. That's funny. There's no save button on the edit page. Okay. All right. Was that, was that the only two things? Yes. Okay. I think any other discussion will probably be all data related. So these are just these little things that the trainers are bringing to me. So. Okay, so far everything is working. As you can see, they're using it. The data's in there, which is good. Pushing for more observations with the trainers and everything. So. Okay. Yeah, no complaints on my end so far. All right, perfect. I did not do my job at all on Wednesday. Oh, unless they did. No. Do you guys want to go through that now? I'm, I'm doing it. I'm starting to look at it on the side right now. Yeah. Okay. I, I didn't know if you wanted to wait because you didn't understand the email or. No, I just didn't. I just didn't do my thought. Okay. Yeah, no, you're right. I was actually. Yeah, I was waiting on the. Yeah, what you said. Okay, so it's good to go. So I can do it now, but I was, I was waiting. Okay. Of course. All right. I mean we could go through them together really quick if you want. I mean, it may take the rest of the call. No, I mean, I can do them. I, I was thinking about what we might need to show on Wednesday. So we need to show copies of the observations. We'll need to show like maybe the 3016-90s. So the observations on 36 and 90s are good. So is there any dashboard that you're comfortable kind of showing yet to the gms? I mean we could show them pretty much everything here. I think the, the, this, the 369 dashboard is fine. Yes. I still may need to go back through and make some changes like these. I haven't done these yet, but I'll have that ready by, by Wednesday. I think this dashboard is fine because I don't think any gym is going to look at the numbers and be like, oh, that's incorrect. Right. Just the idea behind the dashboard. So I think this is fine to show them. Which ones are changing and not the performance is changing. 3060 dashboard. Yeah. Oh, hold on. Round one. I should put those menus over there too. So onboarding satisfaction. We're going to keep the percentage here. The last time we discussed, these are going to change to 10 same. So we're not editing any of the 30, 60, 91 so the actual, the actual onboarding satisfaction is 3.8 out of 10. No, because remember the. This measurement first was 1 to 5. I believe we had changed three questions. We change. I don't remember the specific question, but I remember was question 8, 9 and then on the 90 day we change question 6 also. 6, 8, 9 and 10. I believe so, yeah. So just like the observation where we have to go back in and make those five, ten, those threes five or however we want to do it, we may have to do the same thing. Also one of the questions I think is the confidence. It was more on a. I don't think it was on a number scale. It was maybe in the back end I was, I was. It was saving as number but it was. Or the feedback. I think it was the feedback. It was positive, negative, whatever. And we also change it too. So now it's looking for a number and it's not looking for that word. I think it was the feedback. So we got to find that one. And I believe it was this one, if I'm not mistaken. Or are this one. I gotta look at it again. Or maybe this one is the same. Because we're going to change the performance observations. But we weren't. We didn't have a plan to change the 30, 60 90s. No, no, we did not. So but I think most of these will stay the same. Hold on. So the question that we changed. Let me just actually go back to them real quick so I could understand. So for the 30 and 60, we change confident retention. No, we did 10 too. Right. Our 10 was already like that. So. So that's perfect. So now we just got to go back sa and see what the old database had and I could probably do those too. But we just got to go back in now and see what the old database had because a 10 would be a 5, a 3 would be not. Yeah, a 5 would be a 10, a 3 would be a 5. Right. So if we look at the back end for some of these 36 to 90, then it's going to have scoring from 1 to 5 when it should be from 1 to 10. So we got to make those changes. So the dashboard is going to show. Is always going to show. Why do I keep going to observation? The dashboard is always going to show out of five. So like the performance is one, the confidence is one and the retention. Right. Because these were initially one to five. So it's doing it out of five, it needs to do it out of ten and this is probably up to eight because we probably have had some new scores. Our new survey with, with the 1 to 10 scale. So it's, it's the numbers up there a little bit more. But we still need to go in and make some changes to the old ones. And I can bet if I look at, if I look at the database, it's probably saying the same thing. So if I go to the 369 database, so I could just look at the date. But yeah, so you're gonna have 5 and 10. So all these looks like they're new. Everything in August. And then. Hold on. Oh, so we only have 13. Okay. I also can't get to the completed surveys to edit them. I can't figure out how to get to those. I don't think. I don't perform the observations or the 30, 16, 90. I don't think I had an edit option for the 36 to 90. Did I create. I don't remember if I created one. I know I created an edit option for the observation. Where can I go to the old observations to edit them? Not the old one. Well, so if you go to. If you go to observation here and you open, say like this person. If you open it right, and you scroll to the bottom, there's an edit option here. Okay, got it. No problem. But read the email so you understand, because the one that says not measurable is really observed, unless on the. In the database, it's not measurable, if that makes sense. A little confusing. Oh, okay. Damn. Yeah. Oh, sorry, I was unmuted. I got to the next time. Like, hopefully we don't have to make any more, like, changes like that. But the next time I probably need to, like, download the database, export it to Excel, have it before I go in and do these changes. Just the email. I think you were at it. I don't know why the search name is not coming up. That's weird. Let me close this for a little bit and reopen it. I don't know why my email is acting like this. You're in the old outlook. I never switch. But it never used to act like this because I have so much crap open. You prefer the new one? Okay. This is it right here. Yeah. All right. So you guys got this email, right? Yeah. Okay, so basically, if it's. If it's not measurable, which is going to be 10, you're going to change not measurable to observe. Unless it's marked as NM in the data set, which is the sheet right here. See? Attach. Then keep it as not measurable. And I'll show you what that means in a sec. If it says not observe, we're going to keep it as not observed. If it says observe, we're going to change it to not observe. All right, so let's go through. Let's go through the first one. So I could kind of show you guys what I'm. What I mean. So this Excel sheet is the old database before we Change everyone from 1, 2, 3, NM to observe, not observe, which in the back end is really 10, 0 and NM following? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, sure. Okay. All right. I mean, I understand the changes. I'm just spending more time relating it to the actual observation. All right, so let's, let's. Let's go through that. So if. So this is the new. This is what we want it to be. Right? So this is going to be. Or what is it? What it is now? So this is the new version. So if it's a 10, then it's observe. If it's a 0, then it's not observe. So this is Yegord right now. Or is Yegord. Is Yegord real? Yeah, so let's. Let's do that one together. So I'm gonna. I'm gonna walk through that one with you so you could understand what I'm saying. So it's the one that I have highlighted in. In y. These. Right? So this is. This is the new. This is how we have it now. So this is the old one. So three would be 10, right? Observe. The first one for eboard. So this would be zero. One would also be zero. So these would be not observed. This would be the same. And then this would be N M. Does that make sense? Needs to be observed. Unless it's nm in the sheet. Correct. So, dang, what did she measure from this person? So, but do you guys understand this so far make sense? Yeah. You're gonna go into eboards. Yes. Yeah. All right, so I'm gonna put them side by side. And then. So this is. Come on. Okay, so let's start from the top. So why God? All right, so we're looking at this observation. So let's start with general question number one. Right? So general question number one for why God? Ibor Igor. Got a three, right? So they got a three. So a three back then is converted to a ten. Observe. So this should be. So let's edit real quick. So the first four should be observed. Are you changing it or you want me to change it? Okay, so the first four should be observed, right? So 1, 2, 3, 4, and then the next three should be not observed because 2, we're doing zero. Also like it. We didn't have a. We didn't have a description. It was just 2, 1, 2, or 3. And then NM. We didn't have, like, a description to it. Like observe, not observe. Should it be something on the center? Like, would it lower the scores overall if you made that zero, too? Oh, yeah. You have to have this be a zero, one or a two, right? Huh. So what we're saying. So a two in the old system was like, we kind of saw it, but it needs work. But in the new system, we either observed it or we didn't. Correct. So what do we want group that score to be? Does that go to zero or does that go to observed? Because there is no longer like, oh, it needs work. Right. What do you want to put that under? Do you want to put it under observe or. Or not observe? How many entries do you have so far that would be changed by this? Every single observation. Observation that was done before. It's the ones in front of you, Ray? Yeah. Yeah. Pretty much everything that was done before August, all the observations. So there's only like, what, a dozen in here? Yeah, probably. Yeah. Okay, so it doesn't sound like a change in these scores would be that big of a variable to consider. No, I would say we leave it at zero. What are y' all thinking? I agree with that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So not observed in will not move. Is that correct, Omar? Yeah. So we'll leave these as not. So. Yeah, and that's kind of what I put. Not observe will just stay not observe. So that's what you put in your email. I agree with. Yeah. 1, 2, 3, 4, which is this 1, 2, 3, 4. And then we have 1, 2, 3 that are twos, which is 1, 2, 3. And then if you realize also. So we have the 1, 2, 3, which is twos, but this one, which is general question number we do. So it needs to be observe because it's a three. And then the first. So now we're in the SA role. The first role, roll one is showing three, but it's showing NM here. So that's why I meant by if it's showing NM, just check to make sure it's not actual NM. But if it's a 3, then you move it to observe. Little confusing. And then the second role question is also a three. So it's going to be observe. And then there is a not observe, which is number three, but it's shown as an nm. Oh, that's kind of off. And then number. Hold on, I got confused. Let's go back up. So three. So that's correct. No, this should. So hold on. Now let's see what you guys waited for me. Okay, so three, two, two, three. So roll. So this is three. Two should be not observed. And then roll three. This should be observed. So this is what it looks like. Yeah, but because these are all two back in the days like so unless you want to switch these sa to observe. But yeah, because this would have. These would. Most of these would have been two which would have helped the score because right now this score is 4.7. Being that. Right. Faith, I know I lost you guys like five minutes ago, but that really makes me think now it's just back up, man. Oh, what are we thinking? Can we go to the top really quick? One more? Yeah. So the all of the not observed because in this instance Mia really didn't get to see a lot. No, I guess that's fair. Okay, so scored a 2.5 on their role specific observation out of 10. So this is going to highlight a lot I think in the, in the properties. But this person was being observed. But remember this is based on a three or four scale scoring where back then we were also looking for somewhat incompliant. Right. Oh maybe they have everything on. But I don't know. Well I don't know what they were looking at at that time. But the two would suggest that they are incompliant 90. But something is missing. That's why they got a two. Yeah. So exactly. Right. So like what Omar is saying and one placement really like where we would want to like if the training specialist sees that that's like horrific checking. Right. And I don't know, you know, I know we're going back and forth on like how we measure and how we put non measurable or not, you know, so maybe it doesn't show as bad. But like that's one where you step in, you walk into the back and you're like Jeff, you won't believe what I just saw. Like you need to take care of this right away. So I don't know, you know that's just kind of what I'm what I was thinking there with this. So I don't know because I mean. This two could mean because again these were two. So it's not like they just. Maybe in this one they, they confirmed the room type but they didn't confirm the rate. What's the comment on this? Because I wonder if this came up when Danny had mentioned that all of our observations right now are check in specific. And if this wasn't like granted, I wouldn't have had her fill this out if it wasn't an actual check in. But I wonder if it was disclosed. Anywhere in the comment. But she, but if that happens, Faith, we just put not measurable because then the scoring will ignore that. It won't count that against them. So again, this one might have been just in the early days where we're learning how to fill out still. But as we get further in, right. Like you know, if you, if there's no chance to even score this, it's not fair. Right. We put not measurable here. Right. Omer, this is calculating, this is ignoring not measurable for the calculations at the top, right? Yeah, yeah, it is, it is. So it's. This is scoring out of 19 rather than out of 22 because three were not measurable. Yes. I have to offer my four o'. Clock. So I would say think about this. I mean you guys let me know, I could probably work on most of them. You want to keep it like this. Just train the training specialist on any. Any further that we want to. We want to look at. Yeah, it's not going to help us nor you Omar, as a compliance of this. Right, so. Yeah, I agree. I'll take care of these though, if you, if you consider taking care of the 3060 90s, I'll take care of these. Okay, I understand now. And I wrote down some extra notes for myself. So I'll get these changed today. Okay. There, there. So but based on what I did here, like it's. It should be self explanatory. I mean all the threes will be observed because the threes would equate to 10 in how we're doing it now. Twos and ones would be zero and NM would be NM. There are about three. Three team members or three observation that that is missing. I. I got to look for the database, the backup database that have those three. But other than that, everyone else is there in that Excel sheet. Can you, can you. I gotta drop 4 o'. Clock. Can you do 3 to 4 tomorrow for me and you, Omar? Yes. Yeah, I should be on to number three to four. Let's see. All right. Ray, Faith, you don't have to go to this one that you're about to get the email for. Actually hold on. Can we do four? Actually I could do three to four. I could move this to four. I have a one on one in Cocoa Beach. But yeah, yeah, let's do three to four. Yeah. All right. Yeah. All right. All right. So. Right. Faith, you're about to get this, but you don't need to be at this meeting. This is just me. No more talking about the presentation on Wednesday. Okay. All right, Bye. All right. Good to be sure. Thank you. Cool. Was there anything else that you guys had? It's sa. It's. Good, man. How are you? It's. SA. Hello? Hi. Hi. Are you busy? No, I can. I can listen. What's up? No, I can listen. I'm just typing or finish finishing up a code. About Jul. I've been annoyed all day. And then she. Me too. You what? Did you read Julie's email? No, I haven't checked my email in a little bit. She said there's an update coming for September. As of now, it looks like the 10th. It could slide back to the 24th depending on the rest of development testing. Our next scheduled call. Our next social meeting is the fifth, and I'm sure that won't be enough time to get info put together. Would you like me to look at time this week for us to touch back on the new feature? Yeah. What if it's the same feature that. Do you know that? That's what it is. I mean, that's what she told me. It was just a receipt printed. I mean, it's just where to go to print the receipt. But I. We didn't get into details. I don't think she know those details when I spoke to her a few weeks ago. So I guess it's not that big of a deal. But. Yeah, well, I mean, if you want to set up something. If you want to set up something, I mean, we could. I mean, do you just want to ask her? Do you want to respond to the email and say, all right, thank you, sir? Yeah, when I. Yeah, I'll probably write to it later or once I finish this. But yeah, I could just say I. I believe based on what we discussed, this is not. This doesn't require like major training or something because it's just print. Just a print receipt. The receipt feature being added or something like that. Yeah. So I can reply. You say, I. I believe this one should be fairly easy and doesn't require a. Like an actual whatever since it's just the receipt being added is just how to print the receipt. But I. You guys don't work. You don't. You don't work on their training manual. Right. Because I believe Kathleen has all those information already or all those screenshot. Well, that's part of the problem with Johanna and sa. I mean, I want to say. No. Okay. As part of the problem. And that's something I tried to very tactfully bring up to her on our call last week without saying, like, this before, but I was like, you guys have stuff in way too many places. I think your bigger problem, like, wow, is is that if I need to find something, I can go to two different places to find it, and all 10 of those places may not be updated. I was like, you want to think about the last email you sent? You put in all these locations. Like, you shouldn't be updating things in all those locations. Like, if you have a wow. SharePoint, like, why do you also think you need the documentation? Like, that separate documentation of a book? Like, that's time license. I just don't really understand. Then we have a training, and then our training, like, update. Just the amount of money being spent to, like, keep materials updated for a while, in my opinion, is a little crazy. And it should all live in one place. But no, that's why we wouldn't create a manual for them. This was a whole thing when Victor was here. Because again, it did not. It didn't make sense. Right? Like, hold on. Sorry. I'm getting, like, three different texts based on the thing that I'm working on. Huh. I was just gonna answer them now. Like, I have. I have, like, four emails. Two of them that. Because the way I'm going to reply to it, I'm like, hey, I believe LND has Kathleen from. LND has all these screenshots already if you want to reach out to her. Okay. Yeah. Tell me what the email says. You'Ll be. You want me call you on teams? Yeah. All right, let me do that. Okay. It. Hello? Okay. Oh, that was loud. I'm sorry. I was laughing at my team. Sorry. They're, like, yelling across the hall. Right before I. All right, so this one I need Diane. That I could do later. So this one from Julie. So they sent an email, and of course, you know, she include everyone. Diana, Sheena. I'm currently reviewing the World Loyalty Training Guide and notice that we still have images from Mr. Sums. We need new screenshots from FriendX console to update the guide. Is there a way to. To access FDC for these images? Please let me know. If not, could you or your team assist with the attached document? And then she's like, omar, is this something you want to handle or something you need my team to handle? So it was originally from Joanna. So let me see the attached document. It. I think Valeria has.","📅 **Meeting Overview**: 
The meeting was primarily focused on addressing system issues related to employee management, specifically concerning new hire visibility and database inconsistencies, as well as discussing observation scoring updates.

🎯 **Key Decisions Made**:
- Determine the cause of new hire McKenzie's visibility issue in the backend database and reactivate her profile.
- Implement a new method for viewing deactivated employees separately to prevent confusion.
- Reassess the observation score reporting system and update the scales from a 1-5 scoring system to a 1-10 system.

📋 **Action Items**:
- **Omar**: Investigate and resolve the employee management system's backend issues by separating deactivated employees' data.
- **Faith**: Review and update the observation scoring database for previous entries, converting all 2s and 1s to 0s unless otherwise noted, by the end of today.
- **Omar and Team**: Prepare dashboards and data for the upcoming Wednesday presentation.
- **SA**: Review email from Julie regarding updates and coordinate with L&D team to ensure availability of screenshots for the FriendX console update.

💡 **Important Discussions**:
- Clarification on the scoring transition from previous assessment systems to ensure that observations accurately reflect performance without lowering previous scores unfairly.
- Emphasis on the necessity of a streamlined process for updating training materials and maintaining consistency across platforms.

⚠️ **Risks & Issues**:
- **Potential Risk**: The visibility issue with McKenzie's profile highlights potential systemic issues that might need addressing to avoid future HR complexities.
- **Observation Scoring**: Ambiguity in the transition from old to new scoring metrics may lead to inconsistency in employee evaluations if not addressed promptly.
- **Documentation Update**: Lack of updated screenshots for the World Loyalty Training Guide could delay team training and integration.

📅 **Next Meeting/Follow-up**:
- A follow-up meeting is scheduled for tomorrow from 3-4 PM to finalize preparations for Wednesday’s presentation.
- Ensure all updates, especially those related to observation and dashboard updates, are complete by then.

Prepare necessary data and ensure all team members are informed of changes and updates before the next presentation.","[{""title"": ""Investigate McKenzie's back-end data issue"", ""dueDate"": null, ""assignee"": ""Katie"", ""category"": ""development"", ""priority"": ""high"", ""description"": ""Collaborate with the team to resolve the error message related to McKenzie's profile indicating she already exists, though not visible.""}, {""title"": ""Recreate separate section for deactivated employees"", ""dueDate"": null, ""assignee"": null, ""category"": ""development"", ""priority"": ""medium"", ""description"": ""Create a separate page or filter to display deactivated employees and prevent data from being cluttered in the main directory.""}, {""title"": ""Fix save button issue on the Manage Access page"", ""dueDate"": null, ""assignee"": null, ""category"": ""development"", ""priority"": ""urgent"", ""description"": ""Investigate and resolve the missing save button problem when changing a department for a CFT, specifically Asael Gomez.""}, {""title"": ""Prepare 30-60-90 dashboard for presentation"", ""dueDate"": ""2023-11-22"", ""assignee"": null, ""category"": ""meeting"", ""priority"": ""high"", ""description"": ""Ensure the 30-60-90 dashboard is updated and ready to be presented to GMs by Wednesday with observations and necessary documentation.""}, {""title"": ""Update performance metrics to scale from 1 to 10"", ""dueDate"": null, ""assignee"": null, ""category"": ""development"", ""priority"": ""high"", ""description"": ""Adjust the performance metrics in the 30, 60, 90 dashboards to reflect a scale from 1 to 10 rather than from 1 to 5.""}, {""title"": ""Edit old observations with new scoring rules"", ""dueDate"": null, ""assignee"": ""Faith"", ""category"": ""review"", ""priority"": ""high"", ""description"": ""Adjust old observation records to match the new scoring framework where threes are treated as tens and twos or ones are zeros.""}, {""title"": ""Finalize changes to 30-60-90 surveys"", ""dueDate"": ""2023-11-22"", ""assignee"": null, ""category"": ""research"", ""priority"": ""high"", ""description"": ""Ensure all changes to 30, 60, 90-day surveys are completed, transitioning from old to new scoring and wording standards.""}]",dde53e65-d861-4340-b0a6-3417e0e7b290,2025-08-26 18:57:59.699287,f,,1,,,

Does that make sense? Like so in talent acquisition, you're not supposed to do that. Every wreck should be a new wreck so that you have historical data on those, but it's not. Golf cart attendant is one wreck and everyone is hired into that one wreck. I see, I see. So it's always the wreck always gonna be. Yeah, right. You see what I'm saying? Yeah. But it shouldn't be like that. You should be able to see that. I had five golf cart attendant wrecks and this is the history of all of those wrecks. That's really how it should work. And Trisha's been trying to get that changed for a while, but I don't think our systems would allow us to do that or something. And so that's what's happening is that when they're asking them to open that position, if it's somebody, it's up here, it's up here. Vi says all of their information is up here. They don't write anything down. Oh. But that really speaks to some of the things that Westgate. That's the problem in TA is that because they turn over those team, those recruiters so often, somebody just wouldn't know and they would just back for the wreck. That's what's happening. So Trish is going to have to figure out a way to get that. Like. Yeah, I don't know what she's going to be able to do there, but. Okay. Okay. So. So we're good with those three checklists I'm sending them. I was just going through them in the, in the LMS to make sure that they were built properly. And so we're good with those three titles. So Guest Relations, Guest Experience and Resort Services Operator. Hold on, what was the second one? Guess. Guest gem. Oh, Jim. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes. Okay. Golf cart and Bell Staff. We're gonna leave it how it is for now. As in. As in we're not turning them on. We'Re not putting them, we're not separating them. Okay. Oh, we're not separating. Right. We're gonna leave it how it is. Bell services for now. There's. There's equally the same pros and cons with separating them and keeping them together. Spoke to pretty much everyone again from the gyms that would be affected, the department leaders that would be affected, hr. And. I mean the pros and cons, we're looking at more of a elevated department. Right. And if we bring in team members that are more guest facing, then it will elevate the department a little bit more. However, the plan, if we keep it. So we're just going to keep it would be. And that's one of the conversation I had with HR this morning. How does. How do we promote this position? Right. Because it's a. It's like a multi job position. How do we promote it? And then when we hire someone for the field and that would be up to me. How do we. How do we decide who goes where? Right. So what we've came up with was that when we hire someone, the position is going to be post as best services and then it's going to say like golf cart duties and then bell services, bell staff or something like that. Right. And the description will be for golf cart. So that's kind of what we discussed this morning. And so we still want to hire them to do that specific area, whether it's golf cart or bell staff. However, their training is going to be everything together right now. If they're in bell staff because that's what they're hired for and they. And we need help in golf cart, then they'll go to. Then they'll help. Right. So that's. That's kind of how we're approaching it. Okay. So is the thought that we want to then combine the two checklists into one. Yes. And figure out where there's overlap and do we want to do this now? So it's just sitting there ready, waiting to go or are we going to wait until we see the na actually hit and they. And then discuss how. How that impacts the checklist? Because this is the one where we can really use. Yes, this is the one we could. Really use any on this one. So did we. Did we tell you that it got moved from 2026 to scoops instead of. It's gonna be in Q4 of 2025. Things just told. Could be December, could be November. Yeah. Should we hold off? Because right now I rewrote it as if there was no N A. So I pulled out anything that was specific to golf cart because of the. The properties that don't have golf carts. Yeah, but how would the properties with golf cart operate? Because it's general enough that says. So that was that. Was that because they're very. The properties with golf cart. The golf cart trainings are very specific. So all I changed was I pulled out the two lines about golf cart training that were on day two. And it just says complete any additional CP training, practical exams and practice as required by your property. Okay. So that it just doesn't so it would. You'd have to keep with whatever record keeping you currently for the practical exam you wouldn't be able to use the lms. What about further down on that checklist where it goes over? There's two different other items. The Learn golf cart inspection, cleaning and maintenance. Learn out of service golf cart ticket. Those are all actually hot sauce items. When I spoke to Shane, he said that all those items except for like the, the cleaning and maintenance part, but the tickets, the sign out procedure, the check in procedure, all that are hot sauce items. So I was shoving them under there. Not completely. Okay, so the lakes for. For inspection and all those. Yes. For, for the lakes they use a different program to sign out. They have like a golf cart program that they use to sign out. But for the inspection and all that everyone use between the villas and the lakes they do use hot sauce. But for signing and signing out golf card, they use a different program at the lakes. Okay. And I think we had put like other. Our programs or something like that there. I don't remember. Any golf cart. I had shoved them all under hot sauce so that I can, I can pull them back out. And then. So then do we want to reinstate everything as it. As it was before and then just wait for the N.A. put any golf cart items that were on the golf cart attendant checklist that weren't already on bell services. I just, I feel like once we get the NA you may have to go back in. Right. That's why I'm like. And just kind of readjust. Four months. They didn't say. The problem is, is that they didn't say when in Q4. So I mean we're a month from Q4. Right. But. Right, Ari? Yeah. Yeah, pretty much. I mean who's Ryan Gaines? I have no idea. Westgate person. Yeah, he's. Email me me about Tablo Access. I don't. Table access. Rental revenue from Westgate. Grand Central from New York. Ryan Gaines. Oh, I know. Yes. At this rate, are we getting that Checklist out on 91? No. No. So at this rate, I don't mind. There's a possibility with the 10 one. I don't know if that's even on a work day, but the 101 release. We could ask Belinda on our next call. Like where is this at in Q4? I would just wait to be honest because you're. I don't want to, but that's just going to be double world. Okay, so let's go over it again. Once we know the NA Is. Yeah. Are just Created now with NA in mind. So once we get the na, you don't have to worry about, like, recreating anything and combining it. Hopefully. Hopefully. And combining it will kind of make it easier for you too. I mean, it's kind of one checklist. I like that, Dex, in the computer screen. I don't know who drew that. That's pretty cool. Okay, so I'll leave that. I'll just put a tickler thing in the file to revisit the checklists on 10.1 and find out where we are with the NA feature and how the jobs have all spun out. And can we all agree on. Yeah, that belongs to the checklist. Yeah. All right, so I think that's it about checklists. Okay. The only thing we were just. I was just mentioning to Adam is that it looks like all the job change profiles also include the Resort Ops Day 1 checklist. And they should not. Right. Say that again. The profiles that we use to assign courses for job change, because we have to assign them to new hires one way and job changes to the other. The job change ones include the Resort Ops Day 1 checklist. Now, if you're changing jobs, should you have done everything that's in that Resort Ops day one already and that you don't need that checklist again? So you're going from corporate to resort op. Okay, so then there's going to be overlap there, though, because in the corporate security and the one. The day one for corporate that Chris and I did like that I started. And security, it's basically the same thing. If you have adp stuff like that, like the majority of it's the same. Yeah. Like instead of meeting gm, it's like meeting your department leadership. Instead of property tour, it's like building. Tour, stuff like that. Throwing it out there because they would need those things. But. Nothing can ever. I mean, we could go back all of those. Well, it's a whole. It's a whole separate course that they have to do. So I feel like you would want to just remove it if you're not. If there's anything to sign it if you're transferring. Like, if I'm a resort, let's say I'm on Omar's team, but then I go to like housekeeping. Is there a way to. It's only going to understand that the. That tiling is going to not stuff that they're coming from. Yeah. So if you're going from resort to. Resort, it's a duplicate. I would just say leave it off. Okay. So that. That's a change that has to be then made to all the existing profiles. So do you want to change it? What do you mean? So if I go in already, I probably shouldn't have brought this up. Today feels like a Friday and it's only Tuesday so probably not. So if I look at job teams. So here's characters and if I go over here because this is such a stupid thing. Sorry. So I'm changing jobs. I do the welcome to Resort Ops and the animated character performance checklist. So do we still want them to do welcome to Resort Operations? It's built into every job change profile. So KP would have to go in and delete them all. Can you just turn them off? She can, she can delete. She'd have to delete out that class. She can't turn it. She would want us to leave it running. But she'd just have to delete that class. It's not a big deal to delete the one class but I just didn't want to. I just noticed it today when I was, when I was fixing the ones when I was sending her the information for Omar and I was like ah crap. Can we just ask, can we bringing this back up and bring it up with Alex. Okay. I just don't want to make decisions about reserve ops without him. Okay. Moving on. Quick hit things. The well loyalty screenshots. All good. Did you want. All good. Okay. So you're good. You're going to send them to Joanna? Already did. Spoke to her this morning. Who pays what is is still uncharged to go out. So I think you wanted to launch it the 28th. Yes. So the reason for that is I have my meeting on the 20th, my front office national meeting on the 29th. Okay. So I just want to show it to them real quick and show it to them there at the meeting. Okay. Yeah, we did. We did decide to trial a survey on the end of it. So there will be one extra thing. So it's going to be the elearning the chart and then just a five question survey and it's just a tiny experiment and then we'll figure out strategy going forward for how we would want to if we want to scale it. Okay. So that's that. Yeah. I realized I did not have a clue what you guys were talking about the other day. That's right. I did kind of grab you as you were walking down the hall. I was really mad at that point too. I did talk to Alex a bit. Got his perspective. His is a little different. We talked a little Bit about it. Okay, so we'll make sense. Scale it off every time water park at some ridiculous hour of the morning. I sent you to water park. I saw that. I'm look at the head but I'm. Like these are going out yesterday bled into today. But what do you call. So I don't know if you want to go over those or if there was other stuff that. That that's all that I had because needs to get out the door. So. So, so I can move on to the other stuff if you wanted to go over those or if you wanted. If there was other stuff that you had on your agenda. No, I think that was it. Did Julie respond and say that that's what the meeting is about? Oh, I was going to say that Friday at 2:00'. Clock. Yeah. What was she thinking? Wait, she said that meeting at 2 o'? Clock? Yes. I didn't see that I was Friday. Of a holiday weekend. What was, what was the reply from her though? Did she say I don't think any. Of them are on the email because. When I originally Elite. Hold on. Responded to her took everybody off. Am I yes to this or not? Oh she just said sounds good, I'll get something on the calendar. So she didn't really answer if it's the. I'm gonna go into the holiday weekend. Pissed off. If it's the release. But if it's the receipt, I'm sure it's a receipt release. And okay. Honestly I don't think you need to put anything together for that. Okay. Okay. Okay cool. It's. And if you do it's something really simple. Okay. Where to go, where to click print. Okay. I saw the one for. I figured out where the one was for for folios. So when I saw. It's just because kind of you hit the little three dots and yeah you hit receipt. And I mean if it's, if it's. It's for the 50 hold or the hold whole. I'm assuming it would be somewhere under the whole section. Right. I mean that would probably be the best place to put it. So I don't, I don't see a lot of training needed for that. Okay. It seems like it's just an email and it's just gonna hound yeah you or me until something so she has proof that they were. I'll just send out normally send out that email. They were informed. So that was the only other thing that I had. And then yeah it's just water park. So I did. Did front desk agent and I did Front desk managers first. The front desk managers would take the front desk agent course and the front end. The front desk manager course. The front desk manager will take the frontex agent course for. For water park. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. And then water park team members would just take their own except for Smoky Mountain, who would have them take front desk agent and water park team members since they're going to be the ones issuing the. Yes. And I do think it's not necessary, but I do think the water park should take the water park even though they're not going to be doing anything. Oh, the Smoky Water. The Smoky's water park. Because eventually. Okay, we may get them their own tablets and have them. Actually, they. I think they still need to take it as. Because if someone comes and say, hey, I didn't get, you know, fans or whatever, rather than coming back to the front decks, I would like for them to look it up right there rather than sending them back to the front decks. Okay. So you're going to equip them to be able to do that. Okay. I need to check in with River Ranch and the lakes. Well, I need to check in with Michelle to see if the water park. If the lakes and River Ranch have got their access yet and their devices. That's kind of her job. And if the, the link you send, if it's the Cook reference guide that you had and you just kind of put it there. I mean, I'm sure it's. I'm sure it's good to go. I jazzed it up a little bit. I gave it. I gave it a quiz at the end. Okay. So, yeah, I mean, it's all the same material, so it should be. It should be good. I'm trying to think if there was anything. Is it interactive or just. I started them out. It's not super interactive. I mean, there's some tabs and things that they can click on. There's a drag and drop. Okay. Some flip cards. I try to start out most of the lessons with a question and try and let them puzzle it out on their own first or take a guess at least, as opposed to just here's all the information. Right. So, you know, kind of that. More of that discovery type mindset as opposed to what you call. And it's set up just like, just. It's in the same 360. It's kind of same idea as Megan's that you can make comments on, on the screens. So. Okay, cool. Anything. I'm gonna go through it because I was a little delirious here. So I know there's a typo or two that I couldn't find and I'm like, I don't care. They're going out anyway. That's right. So I'll just, I'll just go give it one more pass through and make sure. There was nothing that I was a little iffy on the wording okay. For that. And I know we never. You still haven't heard about the idea of that it doesn't matter if they're staying on their, their, their usage. So I was intentionally vague to kind of leave that. Yeah, yeah, I, yeah, I wouldn't get into that too much. They're just going to follow their current procedure and the current procedure right now if a owner that books outside of their week outside of their account, if they can prove that they're an owner, we're still giving them the benefit. So if they book through Expedia Hotels.com we're still giving them all the benefits. If they can show, hey, I'm an owner with their phone or whatever, their, some of them still have their old card, we still give them the owner's benefit. Okay. Now just thinking of this, I know right now we're really focused on existing team members but going forward, this will be something we can include in the whole new hire. We can add that whole onboarding thing the same way we're adding who pays. What is there going to be besides this? Are they going to get an introduction to water park policy in some other way or do we need to add any kind of policy information into this? We didn't add anything for the Frontex agent for water park. Right. This kind of came up after the checklist for water park. It says, it says it on. It just says the, like the day. It has like all the tabs. So I think the voucher tab is slash Water park is one of the checklist items. So it doesn't have any sub bullets. Or anything to explain it. No, but what you just said, Yes, I would love for it to be included, whatever, wherever it's going to be placed on the checklist. So when you get to it, that's going to be the lesson. Okay. Right. Yeah. And I think maybe that's the next step too is to start looking at some of these checklist items and turn them into E Learning. Okay. Yeah, absolutely. So, but, so is there anything I need to. So when you're, when you're going through the course, are there any policies and procedures related to water park that I need to add to the Course that would, that would benefit a new hire. So just to keep that in mind. You have to think about that. Let me ask Michelle too. I can't think of any, you know, most of the stuff that I'm thinking of, it's really specific to the water park, like entrance capacity in terms of how many people. Those are just stuff that the water park team members need to know for front decks. Not really, but I'll, I'll, I'll talk to her, Michelle, and see if there's anything. But I really can't think of anything really. And then in terms of assignments, should this also get assigned to resort services operators? The water park? Yes, because they may get a call that says, hey, and they, you know, the guest doesn't know who they're talking to. They dial zero. They think they're talking to the front desk when it's resort services. So they're like, hey, I checked in and can you check how many water park pass I have left or something? So at least they'll know how to check it in reserve services. So yeah. Okay. And they can't add anything. The water park? Yeah, they can't. They wouldn't be able to add. You're not giving them any positions to add entries. Any permissions. Who did I give access from that? I think the managers does have access. I think. Think so. Okay, so we should add then the managers also to take the manager class and the front desk agent class. From resource services. Yes. Okay. Yeah, I think it's the manager. Did I add the supervisors? I think it's just the managers. And then what about guest relations? Do they need any access or do. They need any water? Oh, they do. They definitely do. And the same thing is it's split between guest relations agent and manager. Yes. Because so in guest relations, I just added the access. Recently, every single guest relations team member has access at the villas to override. Okay. Why? Because whenever sales have a new owner, they go to guest relations to get them access to the water park. So they should. So guest relations, agents and UP should take the. Both the, the agent and the. Yes. I said K's gonna love me when I try to explain how we're gonna. I mean you could just assign everything to all of front decks. Well, I don't want them to use if they're not. If they don't have the power to do something to do override, tell them to do it. I see what you're saying. Yeah. Because FriendX agent. Except Smoli. Otherwise the only one. Yeah. Have access to override do. Okay, so then hold on one second. Let me just. Both agent and manager. Okay. And then Smokey Smoke Weeds said their water park people should also take the word for team member. Their front desk agents, they still have the same split between managers have to do the override things. Right. Okay. Okay. So they get. They get assigned same thing. They just also get the water park. Yeah. One to be able to do the issuing point. Correct part. Because it, it should be like the permission should be divided by role. Like it should be based on role. So whichever property should still be manager. I think supervisors are not. If I'm not mistaken. I don't remember. Okay. But yeah. Okay. And then I'll reach out to Michelle for the water park team member piece of it. Because I think their titles get all wonky depending on. Oh, it's, it's. Yeah. I mean they did the consolidation too, like when they were eliminating titles and stuff. And I think honestly, I don't know what they're called. I think they're all called guest experience agent. But it, it's a combination of lifeguards. Okay. And they all work different property do it different. Like the lakes, when I was on the call with them going over like what they need. They use all their lifeguards as cashiers. Okay. And lifeguards. And then they rotate them. And so I'm like, so who, who are cashiers? You're like, oh, everyone. Okay. So they all rotate them. So we may have a bigger group to train there because they. They rotate everyone. Okay. Okay. Now we also. We had talked about. So now you still want. We want to try and have everybody go through the E learning first before we deploy any in person training. Ideally last time we. Because then they don't do the. Then they don't do the elearning. Okay. So yeah, that would be ideal. Yeah. So does that work? So I know, I know our date was 9 8. Is that 98 for. For customer. For guests to start entering the water park and everybody be trained by. Or is that 9 8? We want to start training. 9 8. We want to start training. Okay, gotcha. And we'll just give ourselves a week. So. Okay. Which we may not need last time was like two days. So maybe they could start on Friday. And just by looking at. I just got a report right now from the analytics team that does tableau and every single property is actually using the water park feature already. What? Yeah, not well, all the properties that have water park. So. Okay, so for example, like let's see. Smokey issued 16 vouchers in the last week. We don't need no stinking training. Towers. Issued six fillers, issued 154, tungsten 180. Okay, so the feature is there. I mean, the feature is there, right? So I reach out to Kayla. I'm like, hey, are you using it? He's like, honestly, I kind of use it sometimes because it's just there and it's so easy. Okay, but I'm like, kayla, but what. But why would anybody on a non water park property be hitting the issue button? Because that means. That means somebody's handing them a wristband when they hit issue, correct? No, this is just a report showing how many were issued per property, not showing who issued it overall. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So. All right, well, the training should be really quick. At least they like it. Yeah, they're already using it. Do I need to talk to Faith then about having somebody at all these properties? And then if we're doing three properties simultaneously, how do we want. Do we want to prioritize? I know we have. Don't we have someone at. What's her name? Danny and Smokey? Can she do Smokey? I can talk to Fate and then. Just someone at Ranch. Okay, and who's responsible for which resorts? Hold on. Between Mia and. I'll get it wrong. I just know their big property. I never can remember their small properties. Hold on. Isn't that the Summit? The Summit is on the eight, right? Summit. It sure is. We can't do that. Where is it? Is it the Lakes? Is that the Villas? Damn. Should I cancel? I have a way out. I don't have to speak. I'm just kidding. Jared goes before me and then I go and then you. God damn it. It's always something giving you all the facts so you have them before you make a decision. Okay, fine. This is the last year for them. Every freaking year. Invite someone else. We just. We could take the two hours and do it together. It's me. Then you just combine the whole thing in two hours. I could. It's really from a training perspective, it's mainly for an office, so. Yeah. Would have to come up. We can come up with something. Yeah. All right. Sorry. That's okay. That just. The eight didn't put two and two together. It's the rollout day and the wow day. The wow Summit. Fun. Well, Bill, this is. It just. It will impact whoever is attending. I guess that wow. Yeah. Summit. Because I was gonna say I could just. I could be at the Lakes that day, but the summit, I mean, I could come over there after the summit but I know if Ray's doing it he likes to do the meetings early like he likes to do 9, 10 o'. Clock. But I guess it just depends on who. But we'll definitely need someone at River Ranch and someone at the lakes. Okay. And honestly the, the assistance that they need was really, it was more system related. Not the system messing up but user system assistance. Okay. Yeah. On the water park side or on. The, on the water park side. Okay. I can't log in. How do I like. Yeah, it was, it was mostly most of that that we dealt with. Okay. Yeah. There's definitely a module right at the beginning of the, of the training on how to like your sans account and all that. Yeah. So but they're still, you're still saying that kind of. I was surprised. I mean keeping people. I mean some of those team members, they, they're not that they're not around computers. Yeah. They have a cell phone but they've never linked. They've never had an account. Right. With Westgate. Right. They've never had to log into an email. They've never had to do any of that. I mean I've probably set up three accounts like as new account because they've never had an account, never had an email, nothing. Okay. So. So there, some of them is just going to be very new to logging into a Westgate computer. So that those were probably some of the assistance that they need. Okay. Do you still want to stick with 9899 is there. Is 98 a holiday? Like is 9 is no. 91. Okay. So yeah, I mean I'm good with. I don't know also what the team members schedules look like or anything like that. Let's do 99. That will probably help a little bit better because Morgan is normally off Monday, Tuesday. Sorry Sunday. Monday. So she'll be there on Tuesday. Okay. And I don't know if that's gonna change by then when they make all these changes. Yeah. So we'll do 99. And then for whoever's going to River Ranch is can they get everybody in one day? I have no idea the size of the team or when they're gonna have to spend multiple days going out to River Ranch. I think one day is fine. I met with the team, the front office team is very small and then I met with the water park team when I was out there. Okay. And it's not, it's not a big team. I think one day. I mean everybody else, the other ones are all local. Yeah. And I think we're given 99. I mean, yeah, we're giving them enough time if we send it out today. I'll send out an email to them today, which I think I. Let me talk to Faith first and just confirm that she's got that the trainers are available. Okay. And then I can let you know then. Yeah, but I'm not sending, like, trainers. Name just, like the dates. Right. Okay. I. Well, I had told them 98 two weeks ago. Or I'll send it to Michelle and have Michelle send it out to them. But. Yeah, so we should be good there. Okay. All right. I think that's. I think that's all the questions that I have for Water park at the moment. Okay. So water park. Check this. What. What else was on the agenda for. Your career path thing? I know I said I would do the on demand suggestions for each thing. I added those in. I just need to hyperlink them. Like, review links to the. Okay. Yeah. So like, for front desk, I did guest service fundamentals. I kind of kept it like 5 or less. I did guest service fundamentals. Handling difficult guest service scenarios and then resolving conflicts are good ones. For the advanced Front desk, I did time management essentials. So it does a guide to workplace integrity. Yes. For cft, Effective feedback strategies, A guide to mentoring others, and then a guide to legal. Perfect. And then Jen is. There's some of her left here because. I know you said they could either go into both or one or the other. Yeah. Business writing fundamentals, project management fundamentals, and then effective feedback strategies. That's one that overlaps. Yeah. Supervisor. Five leadership styles to influence a team. A leader's guide to resolving team conflict, Motivating your team Performance management essentials, and then leading.","📅 **Meeting Overview**: 
The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the improvement of the talent acquisition tracking system, updates on various checklists for job roles, and the water park training rollout for different properties.

Learn how to service golf cart ticket. Those are all actually hot sauce items. When I spoke to Shane, he said that all those items, except for like the cleaning and maintenance part, but the tickets, the sign out procedure, the check in procedure, all that are hot sauce items. So I was shoving them under there. Not completely. Okay, so the, the lakes for. For inspection and all those. Yes. Right. For, for the lakes, they use a different program to sign out. They have like a golf part program that they sign out, but for the inspection and all that. Everyone uses to use hot sauce. But for signing and signing up, of course they use a different program at the L. Okay. And I think we had put like other programs or something like that there. Remember. I had sh. Them all under hot sauce so that I can go. I can pull them back out. And then. So then do we want to reinstate everything as it. As it was before and then just wait for the NA and then put any golf cart items that were on the golf cart attendant checklist that weren't already on bell services? I just, I feel like once we get the na, you may have to go back in. Right. That's why I'm like, should we just leave it alone? Four months. The problem is that they didn't say when in Q4. So I mean, we're a month from Q4. Right. But. Right. Are we? Yeah. Who's Ryan Gates? I have no idea. Is a West Gate person. Yeah. Central from New York. At this rate, are we getting that Checklist out on 91? No. No. So at this rate, there's a possibility with a 10 one. I don't know if that's even on a work day, but the 10:1 release. We could ask Belinda on our next call, like, where is this at in Q4? I would just wait, to be honest, because you're. I don't want to, but that's just going to be double. Okay, so let's. Let's go over it again. Once we know the NA is in there and you've settled the whole. I just created now with NA in mind. So once you get the na, you don't have to worry about like recreating anything. Okay. Let's get to October. She should have a better idea of October. Combining it will kind of make it easier for you too. It's kind of one checklist. I don't know who drew that. Okay, so I'll leave that. I'll just put a particular thing in the file to revisit the checklists on 101 find out where we are with the NA feature and how the jobs have all spun out. And can you all agree on everything that belongs to the checklist? Yeah. Okay. All right, so I think that's it about checklists. Okay. The only thing we were just. I was just mentioning to Adam is that it looks like all the job change profiles also include the Resort Ops Day 1 checklist. Say that again. The profiles that we use to assign courses for job change, because we have to assign them to new hires one way and job changes to the other. The job change ones include the Resort Ops Day 1 checklist. Now, if you're changing jobs, should you have done everything that's in that Resort Ops day one already and that you don't need that checklist? Depends. Maybe you're going from corporate to Resort Ops. Okay, so then. So you might. There's going to be overlap there, though, because in the corporate security and the one. The day one for corporate that Chris and I did, like, we aligned with the ID one that I started in security. It's basically the same thing. If you have ADP stuff like that, like the majority of it's the same. Yeah. Like instead of meeting gm, it's like meet your department leadership. Instead of property tour, it's like building tour. Stuff like that. Throwing it out there because they would need those things. But. Nothing can ever just. I mean, we could go back all of those. Well, it's a whole. It's a whole separate course that they have to do. So I feel like you would want to just remove it if you're not. If they're not assign it if you're transferring. Like, if I'm a resort, let's say I'm on Omar's team, but then I go to like housekeeping. Is there a way to. It's only going to understand that the. That a job change to not that they're coming from. Yeah. So if you're going from resort to resort, it's a duplicate. I would just say leave it off. Okay. So that. That's a change that has to be then made to all the existing profiles. So do you want to change it? What do you mean? So if I go in already. I probably shouldn't have brought this up. Kathleen, Today feels like a Friday and it's only Tuesday, so probably not. So if I look at job teams. So here's characters and if I go over here, this is such a stupid thing. So I can't. So I'm changing jobs. I do the welcome to Resort Ops and the animated Character performance checklist. So do we still want them to do. Welcome to resort operations. It's built into every job change profile. So KP would have to go in and delete them all. Can you just turn them off? She can. She can delete. She did have to delete out that class. She can't turn it. She would want us to leave it running. But she just have to delete that class. It's not a big deal to delete the one class. But I just didn't want to. Let's notice it today when I was. When I was fixing the ones when I was sending her the information for Omar and I was like ah crap. Can we just ask. Can we bringing this back up and bring it up with Alex. Okay. I just don't want to make decisions about resort ops without him. Okay. Moving on. Quick hit things. The wow Loyalty screenshots. All good. Did you want. All good. Okay. So you're good. You're gonna send them to Joanna. Joanna. Fabulous. Who pays what is is still on target to go out. So I think you wanted to launch it the 28th. Yes. So the reason for that is I have my meeting on the 20. My front office national meeting on the 29th. Okay. So I just want to show to them real quick and. Okay. Okay. Yeah, we did. We did decide to trial a survey on the end of it. So there will be one extra thing. So it's going to be the. The elearning the chart and then just a brief five question survey. So. And it's just a tiny experiment and then we'll figure out strategy going forward if we want to scale it. Okay. So that's that. Yeah. I realized I did not have a clue what you guys were talking about. The other day when I gave you. I did kind of grab you as you were walking down the hall. I was really mad at that point too. So I did talk to Alex a bit. Got his perspective. His is a little different. We talked a little bit about it. Okay. So. Okay. Makes sense. Scale it up. Water park at some ridiculous hour of the morning I sent you to. Water parkies are going out. So my yesterday bled into today. But what do you call. So I don't know if you want to go over those or if there was other stuff that that that's all that I had because needs to get out the door so. So I can move on to the other stuff. So I don't know if you wanted to go over those or if you wanted. If there was other stuff that you had on your agenda. No, I think that was it. Did Julie respond and say that that's what the meeting is about? Oh, say they're Friday at 2:00'. Clock. Yeah. What was she thinking when she scheduled that meeting at 2:00'? Clock? Yes. I was the Friday of a holiday weekend. What was, what was the reply from her though? Did you. I don't know. None of, I don't think any of them are on the email because when I originally responded to her I took everybody off. Yeah. That was actually on my list to bring Am I supplying yes to this or not? Oh, she just said sounds good. I would get something on the calendar. So she really answer if it's the. So I'm going to go into a holiday weekend pissed off at her tongue. If it's a release but if it's a receipt, I'm sure it's a receipt release. And okay. Honestly I don't think you need to put anything together for that. Okay. Okay. Okay cool. That's if you do it's something really simple. Okay. Where to go, where to click print. Okay. I saw the one for. I figured out where the one was for for folios. So when I saw it's just because kind of you hit the little three dots and yeah. You hit receipt. And I mean if it's, if it's, if it's for the $50 hold or the hold, I'm assuming it would be somewhere under the whole section. Okay. Right. I mean that would probably be the best place to put it. So I don't, I don't see a lot of training needed for that. Okay. It seems like it's just an email and it's just going to hound you or me until something goes out. So she has proof that they were somebody was they were informed. So that was the only other thing that I had. And then yeah, it's just water. So I did the, did front desk agent and I did front desk managers first. The front desk managers would take the front desk agent course and the front and the front desk manager course. The front desk manager will take the frontex agent course. Yes. For. For water park. Oh, okay, sorry. Y. And then water park team members would just take their own except for Smoky Mountain who have them take front desk agent and water park team members since they're going to be the ones issuing the yes. And I do think not necessary but I do think the water park should take the water part even though they're not going to be doing anything. Oh the smoky's water. The smoky water part because eventually okay. We may get them their own tablets and have them. Actually, they. I think they still need to take it as. Because if someone comes and say, hey, I didn't get, you know, bans or whatever, rather than coming back to the front desk, I would like for them to look it up right there rather than sending them back to the front. Okay. So you're going to input them to be able to do that. Okay. Okay. I need to check in with River Ranch and the lakes. Well, I need to check in with Michelle to see if the water park, the lakes and River Ranch have gotten their access yet and their devices. Okay. That's kind of our job. And if the, the link you sent, if it's the Cook reference guide that you had and you just kind of put it there, I'm sure it's. Sure it's good to go. I jazzed it up a little bit. I gave it a quiz at the end. So. Yeah, I mean, it's all the same material, so it should be. It should be good. I'm trying to think if there's anything specific. Is it interactive or just. I started them out. It's not super interactive. I mean, there's some tabs and things that they can click on. There's a drag and drop, some flip cards. I try to start out most of the lessons with a question and try and let them puzzle it out on their own first or take a guess at least, as opposed to just here's all the information. So, you know, kind of that. More of that discovery type mindset as opposed to. And it's set up just like, just. It's in the same kind of same idea as Megan's that you can make comments on, on the screen. So. Okay. So we can use it that way. I'm going to go through it because I was a little delirious here. So I know there's a typo or two that I couldn't find and I'm like, I don't care. They're going out anyway. So I'll just. I'll just go give it one more pass through and make sure there was nothing that. That was a little iffy on the wording. Okay. For that. And I know we never. You still haven't heard about the idea of that. It doesn't matter if they're staying on their, Their. Their usage week. Okay. So I was intentionally vague to kind of leave that. Yeah. Then. So, yeah, I. Yeah, I wouldn't get into that too much. They're just gonna follow their current procedure. The current procedure Right now is a odor that books outside of their week outside of their account. If they can prove that they're an owner, we're still giving them the benefit. So if they book for Expedia hotels.com we're still giving them all the benefits. If they can show hey I'm an owner with their phone or whatever, some of them still have their own card, we still give them the owner's benefit. Okay, now just thinking of this, I know right now we're really focused on existing team members but going forward this will be something we can include in the whole new hire. We can add that whole onboarding thing the same way we're adding who pays. What is there going to be besides this? Are they going to get an introduction to water park policy in some other way or do we need to add any kind of policy information into this. This kind of cable. In terms of. We didn't add anything. Checklist for waterfall. It says, it says it on. It just says the like the day. It has like all the tabs. So I think the voucher tab is slash Water park is one of the checklist items. So it doesn't have any sub bullets. Or anything to explain it. No, but what you just said. Yes, I would love for it to be into the whatever worver it's going to be placed on the checklist. So when you get to it, that's going to be the lesson. Okay. Right. Yeah. And I think maybe that's the next step too is to start looking at some of these checklist items and turn them into elearning. Okay. Yeah, I, absolutely. So, but, so is there anything I need to. So when you're, when you're going through the course, are there any policies and procedures related to waterproof that I need to add to the course that would, that would benefit a new hire? So just to keep that in mind when you're reviewing. I can't think of any, you know, most of the stuff that I'm thinking know if it's really specific to the water park, like entrance capacity in terms of how many people. Those are just stuff that the water park team members need to know for front decks. Not really, but I'll, I'll, I'll talk to her Michelle, and see if there's anything. But I really can't think of anything really. And then in terms of a. Assignments, should this also get assigned to resort services operators? Yes, because then they get a call that says hey and they, you know, the guest doesn't know who they're talking to they dial zero. They think they're talking to the front. That's when you reserve. So they're like hey I checked it. Can you check how many waterborne pass I have left or something? So at least they'll know how to check services. Okay. And they can't add anything? Yeah, they can't. They wouldn't be able to add. You're not giving them any positions to add entries, any permissions. Who did I get access from? I think it's just. I think the managers. The managers think so. Okay, so we should add then the managers also to take the manager class and the frontisk class. From resort services. Yes. Okay. Yeah. And then what about guest relations? Do they need any access or do they need any training on this? Yeah. Okay. And the same thing is it's split between guest relations agent and manager. Yes. Okay. So in guest relations I just added the access recently. Every single guest relations team member has access at the levels to override. Okay. Why? Because whenever sales have a new owner they go to guest relations. Okay. To get that access to the waterfall. Okay. So they should. So guest relations agents and up should take the. Both the. The agent and the vendor. K's gonna love me. I said K's gonna love me. When I try to explain how we're gonna. I mean you could just assign everything to all of front decks. Well, I don't want them to use if they're not. If they don't have the power to do something then don't tell them to do it. I see what you're saying. Yeah. Friend X agent except Smolke. Otherwise they're all going to be complain. Yeah, they're all going to be complaining do. Okay so then hold on one second. Let me just Both agent and manager version. Okay. And then Smokey Smokey just said their water park people should also take the water park team member their front desk agents. They still have the same split between managers have to do the override things. Right. Okay okay. So they get. They get assigned same thing. They just also get the water park. Yeah. One to be able to do the issuing point issuing part because it. It should be like the permission should be divided by a role based on roles. Whichever property should still be manager. I think supervisors are not if I'm not mistaken. I don't remember. Okay. But yeah. Okay. And then I'll reach out to Michelle for the water park team member piece of it because I think their titles get all wonky depending on. Oh it's. It's. Yeah. I mean they did the Consolidation too. Like when they were eliminating titles and stuff. And I think, honestly, I don't know what they're called. I think they're all called guest experience agent. But it. It's a combination of lifeguards. Okay. And they all work different property. Do it different. Like the lakes, when I was on the call with them, going over, like what they need, they use all their lifeguards as cashiers. Okay. And lifeguards. And then they rotate them. And so I'm like, so who, who are cashiers? They're like, oh, everyone. Okay. So they all rotate them. So we may have a bigger group to trade there because they. They rotate everyone. Okay. Okay. Now we also. We had talked about. So now you still want. We want to try and have everybody go through the E learning first before we deploy any in person training. Ideally last time we. Because then they don't do the. Then they don't do the E learning. That would be ideal. So does that work? So I know, I know our date was 98. Is that 98 for. For customer. For guests to start entering the water park and everybody be trained by. Or is that 98? We want to start training. 98. We want to start training. Okay, gotcha. And we'll just give ourselves a week. So. Okay. Which we may not need like two days. So maybe they could start on Friday. And just by looking at. I just got a report right now from the analytics team that does tableau, and every single property is actually using the water park feature already. What? Yeah. Well, all the properties that have water park, so. Okay. Like, let's see. Smokey issued 16 vouchers in the last week. Okay. We don't need no stinking training. Tellers issued six. Phil has issued 154, 80. Okay. So the feature is. I mean, the feature is there, right? So I reach out to Kayla. I'm like, hey, are you using it? He's like, honestly, I kind of use it sometimes because it's just there and it's so easy. Okay. But I'm like, but what? But why would anybody on a non water park property be hitting the issue button? Because that means. That means somebody's handing them a wristband when they hit issue, correct? No, this is just a report showing how many were issued. Okay. Property. Okay. It's not saying who it is. Okay. Okay. I had a smaller attack there. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So. All right, well, the training should be really quick. At least they like it. Do I need to talk to Fish Faith then about having somebody at all these properties? And then if we're doing three properties simultaneously, how do we want. Do we want to prioritize? I know we have. Don't we have someone at. What's her name? Danny and Smokey. Can she do Smokey? I can. I can talk to fate and then just someone at Ranch. Okay, and who's responsible for which resorts between Mia and. You'll have to ask. I'll get it. I'll get it wrong. I just know their big property. I never can remember their small properties. The wow Summit. It sure is. We can't do that. Where is it? Is that the Villas? Yes. Damn. Should I cancel? I have a way out. I don't have to speak. Jared goes before me and then I go. And then you go. God damn it. Something just giving you all the facts so you have them before you make a decision. Okay, fine. It's the last year for them. Every freaking year. Invite someone else. We just. We could take the two hours and do it together. It's me. Then you just combine the whole thing in two hours. Really? From a training perspective, it's mainly front office. So we would have to come up. We can come up with something. Yeah. All right. Sorry. That's okay. That just. The eight didn't put two or two together. It's the rollout day and the wild day. The wild summit. Fun. Well, Phyllis is. It just. It will impact whoever is attending. I guess that. Wow. Yeah. Summit. Because I was gonna say I could just. I could be at the lakes that day. But the summit. I mean, I could come over there after the summit. But I know if Ray's doing it, he likes to do the meetings early. He likes to do 10 o', clock, but I guess it just depends on who. But we'll definitely need someone at river range and someone at the lakes. Okay. And honestly the. The assistance that they need was really. It was more system related. Not the system messing up, but user system assistance. Okay. Yeah. On the water park side or. On the water park side. Okay. I can't log in. It was mostly most of that that we dealt with. Okay. Yeah. There's definitely a module right at the beginning of the. Of the training on how to. Like your Sam's account and all that. Yeah. So. But they're still. You're still saying that? Kind of. I was surprised. I mean, keeping people. I mean some of those team members, they. They're not. They're not around computers. Yeah. They have a cell phone, but they've never linked. They've never had an account. Right. With Westgate. Right. They've never had to log into an email. They've never had to do any of that. I mean, I've probably set up three accounts like as new accounts because they've never had an account. Never had an email. Okay. So. So there's. Some of them is just going to be very new to logging into there. So that those were probably some of the assistance that they needed. Okay. Do you still want to stick with nine eight. Nine. Nine. Is there. Is 98 a holiday? Like is nine is. No, 91. Okay. So yeah, I mean, I'm good with. I don't know also what the team members schedules look like or anything like that. Let's do 99. That will probably help a little bit better because Morgan is normally off Monday. Tuesday. Sorry, Sunday. Monday. So she'll be there on Tuesday. Okay. I don't know if that's gonna change by then when they make all these changes. Yeah, so we'll do that now. Yeah. And then for whoever's going to River Ranch, is can they get everybody in one day? I have no idea the size of the team. Or are they gonna have to spend multiple days going out to River Ranch? I think. I think one day is fine. I met with the team. The front office team is very small that I met with the water park team when I was out there. Okay. But it's not. It's not a big team. I think one team. Okay. I mean everybody else. The other ones are all local. Yeah. And I think we're giving 99. I mean. Yeah, we're giving them enough time. We send it out today. I'll send out an email to them today. Let me talk to Faith first and just confirm that she's got that the trainers are available. Okay. And then I can let you know then. Go ahead. And I'm not sending like trainers. They just like. Okay. Okay. Well, I had told them 98 two weeks ago, but yeah. So we should be good there. Okay. I think that's. I think that's all the questions that I have for Water park at the moment. So water park checklist. For your career path thing. I know I said I would do the on demand suggestions for each thing. I added those in. I just need to hyperlink them like review links to have you review them. Okay. Yeah. So like for front desk, I did guest service. I kind of kept it like 5 or less. I did guest service fundamentals. Handling difficult guest service scenarios and then resolving conflict. Those are good ones. For the advanced front desk, I did time management essentials. Does that align with our competencies it does. A guide to workplace integrity. Yes. For cft. Effective feedback strategies. A guide to mentoring others, and then a guide to lead effectively. And then. Jen, there's some overlap here because I know you said they could either go into both or one or the other. Yeah. Business writing fundamentals, project management fundamentals, and then effective feedback strategies. That's one that overlaps there. Supervisor 5 Leadership styles to influence a team. A leader's guide to resolving team conflict. Motivating your team. Performance management.","📅 **Meeting Overview**: The meeting focused on organizing and refining training procedures, checklists, and the implementation of learning materials specifically for golf cart inspection processes and resort operations. Additional topics included checklist reviews, job change profiles, water park policy onboarding, and upcoming Training.

🎯 **Key Decisions Made**:
- Golf cart procedures would primarily use the Hot Sauce platform.
- Decide to wait for the NA feature upgrade before making substantial changes to the checklist.
- Removal of the Resort Ops Day 1 checklist from job change profiles that transition within similar roles.
- Confirmation that the WOW Loyalty program remains on track for a 9/28 launch.

📋 **Action Items**:
- Continue using Hot Sauce for golf cart checkouts; revisit in October post-NA feature availability.
- Clean up existing checklists, targeting 10/01 for review.
- Assign relevant e-learning modules to staff involved with water park operations by 9/9.
- Confirm trainers' availability and update communication accordingly for the 9/9 training session.

💡 **Important Discussions**:
- The redundancy of Resort Ops Day 1 checklist for employees shifting roles within the same department and potential removal needs.
- Training for water park features needs clarification on policy specifics, roles, and existing training effectiveness.
- Harmonizing efforts across properties to ensure consistent use of new water park procedures.

⚠️ **Risks & Issues**:
- Confusion surrounding which learning platforms and procedures applied at different locations.
- Possible resistance or operational disruptions from adding or removing checklist elements without clear communication and guidance.
- Overlapping responsibilities and unclear role definitions in training assignments need careful attention.

📅 **Next Meeting/Follow-up**:
- Schedule a follow-up once the NA feature is live to finalize checklist updates.
- Ensure a final pass-through of all materials and confirmation of assignments and schedules in preparation for the 9/9 training.
- Set up a meeting post-launch of WOW Loyalty program on 9/28 to evaluate initial feedback.","[{""title"": ""Check in with Michelle regarding water park access and devices"", ""dueDate"": null, ""assignee"": null, ""category"": ""meeting"", ""priority"": ""high"", ""description"": ""Confirm whether River Ranch and the lakes water park have received their access and devices.""}, {""title"": ""Send Wow Loyalty screenshots to Joanna"", ""dueDate"": null, ""assignee"": null, ""category"": ""design"", ""priority"": ""high"", ""description"": ""Finalize and send Wow Loyalty screenshots to Joanna.""}, {""title"": ""Launch 'Who Pays What' on 28th"", ""dueDate"": ""2023-09-28"", ""assignee"": null, ""category"": ""development"", ""priority"": ""urgent"", ""description"": ""Prepare and distribute the 'Who Pays What' materials by the 28th, ahead of the national front office meeting on 29th.""}, {""title"": ""Contact Faith regarding trainer availability for training on 09/09"", ""dueDate"": null, ""assignee"": null, ""category"": ""training"", ""priority"": ""high"", ""description"": ""Confirm with Faith about the availability of trainers for the sessions starting on 09/09.""}, {""title"": ""Prepare Water Park training materials"", ""dueDate"": ""2023-09-08"", ""assignee"": null, ""category"": ""training"", ""priority"": ""urgent"", ""description"": ""Compile and finalize training materials for Water Park team by 09/08 and distribute accordingly.""}]",3003d931-a3da-497c-9879-4abc9eee2454,2025-08-26 23:18:32.220469,f,,1,,,

So then we were giving them little tasks for each other. Yeah. They can activate different spaces at different times. Okay, so there's a. There's a cocktail reception before dinner. Yeah. Oh, yeah. And then you can make them talk to people you want. Plus we can send them to megabytes. Be like, you gotta try one of these. One of these four hot dogs. So. And so. Or whatever, like one of you is posted there. They have to be you at skeeball before they can move on. Or like, whatever that might be. They don't. If they don't. I'll say that. All right, then we go to dinner. I like. I like that. That'll be fun. Dinner then. Evening. Which we, you know, at the Ranch, we did some things, but we can figure out what we want to do. Yeah. What are our common areas? I'm trying to think. The common areas at the Villas where we can do things at that. We had that softball field area. Yeah. And then we have that little Mystic Garden area they made. They used to have the lights. The pre. Lights had that. The lights aren't up anymore. I think the lights are up. I don't think they're working. And then we had that back. So that led to that back area where we did the fire pits. The last time we were at the. Villas, I wasn't here. I missed the. So I've done. Really? I just feel like you've always been here. Lakes, River, Ranch. And this will be my third one. We have that one pool at the. Back that we always use too. To. What's that. What's the name of that pool where we. In. But there's plenty of pool decks with bars. And we've been. Oh, yeah. Oh, my gosh. We always use that back. I was thinking about the ice cream. I was like. And then they. I don't know if we have enough skates. I don't know if we have enough skates. At least it'll be cold out. Should be one fallacy with putting in an ice rink. Even though it's not ice in the middle, the outside is that in the summer, still too hot to go. Ice skating requires any physical. All right, so we'll do something for 9 12. All right. Day two. Day two, conference breakfast. I. I moved that one early just to make sure we can get everything. So that's eight to nine. But that's not abnormal from the other days. We had that one later last year for some reason. Now one thing to keep in mind here is it was Mentioned early on that you wanted Mitch and Jared to open up each day. So we can. I can replace that here. But then we also wanted corporate partners in the morning. So I don't know if we just want to try to squeeze. I need more than 90. I needed 120 minutes. Yeah, I heard that. Both of them, though no one would open one day. One would open the other one to do one each. But then also we have them as part of like some of these things later. Again, we got to tear this to pieces. I just wanted to visualize it and see where we needed to place things. Alex took the notes from every meeting and just dumped everything into this at this point. So that way you had everything that you asked for. And then we could kind of go from there. Becomes 120 minutes. Yeah, we know this is gonna have to shift everything back. But where is. Where is the breakfast gonna be at? I don't think we have that stuff. Yet because you got to get from that breakfast. And if we're doing. We're going right into corporate partners. We got to get everybody over to wherever we're doing. Corporate partners. And would you invite all your corporate partners to breakfast that morning? Well, also, how long to set the room? Let me just ask. Does corporate partners feel like a morning event? There were notes to put it here. Do you remember why? No, there wasn't any reason. It was just like, oh, the biggest. Reason was the lunch with you. I think you wanted them to be able to roll into lunch or something and then they have the whole data. The one thing I had notated was. Yeah, I had in mind usually like. A drink with them afterwards. Right. Usually we do corporate partners and we have some sort of cocktail reception. So we just. So the last time we had a conversation it was going to be on Monday. And the thought was not to do it on that day. To just have them have an easy day, come in and do it. Feed 75, 000 people. Dinner. Yeah, because they're all going to pack those rooms with a lot of people. But it'd be easy enough to swap. And we just take corporate partners. We could swap it with panel and we could have our teams in the morning. So where's the opening? I don't see who's opening this day. Mitch or. Yeah, we. That's what I. That's one of the. My notes I had was that we mentioned we wanted that, but then corporate gardeners kind of forced me to start a little earlier. So if we're going to shift that, that's Going to be easier. Keep in mind, the only dinner I have is the gala. Because you have one night with ketchup night on the town and the other. Day is night out with their. Yep. What's the second night? With who? Yep. Oh, yeah. I love Nicole. Nicole always gives everyone a nickname and you don't know. You just then have to accept it. So you have megabytes night, then two nights out and then gala. Yeah. That's all their dinners. So we want to ship Corporate park. So the night. The night out though is. Yes, yes. That's what I was looking at. Different ideas for events. Two digital dinners. Right. And then Stacy and Charles are. Are supposed to kind of do their own thing with them. Right. Like. Yeah, I think we just need to kick that around a little bit. Is that going to be off property or on property? Is one going to go to SIDS and one going to go to. You originally said you wanted them out. I know, I know, but I'm. Which I would. It's the. It's the heat about. That's an expense that we don't really necessarily need to incur when we have two full. Full service rep restaurants on property. Right. And we're not. But we can do whatever you want to do. Just giving you like keep them one property. What are they waiting Monday. What are they. Monday. We're going to send them everywhere. Sweet drinking. Those are the lows. We also have the dead draft space. So we can use that. That's what they call it now. Dead drafts. Dead drafts. Yeah. I. I think we're gonna have to leave them on. I think for. For cost. For cost containment. We're gonna have to leave them on property. No, I'm logistical. Peter. Do we want that on one on Tuesday or Wednesday? What's that? I think that's just going to depend on what events are going on in Orlando on those two days. Right. Because I need to be able to provide like Nicole, I'll get you some. And then I connect with you on some of those. I still want to do. But yeah, we'll just do them on. We'll do one at SIDS and one. What's that? I think. I don't think they've leveled it yet. I heard it was Golden Corral's leasing it. It's what I heard Golden Corral was leasing it. That's true. Okay. But no, I think they're going to level it. Yeah. It's restaurant there. It's a great location. So yeah, Tuesday night or Wednesday night, it was just going to Depend. But we can flip flop those. But it'll be. We'll do dinner on prop regions, one. On sids, one on Los. You read that. You got that? Okay. Okay. So then do we want corporate partners to shift to the afternoon? What I'm trying to do is tie it into a social event so all the corporate partners who didn't get to speak have time with the GMs. In the past. I feel like we've always had some sort of cocktail either during the event or after the event. That's because it was before the gala. And last year we did it before the gala, which helped with that. What about two years ago, we were at the Lakes. We did the Airplane. There was a bar in the middle of the room. You did at the Airplane. You did it at the Airplane. That was at kickoff at the Villas. And we did do at Villa Italiano. We did a. And each corporate partner could bring one. One person. Right. That was a show. Yeah. Because it turned into. Because they were like, oh, okay. Yeah, yeah. Nicole didn't. We didn't have good. They're all gonna be shows. I. I can tell you the tone. Is definitely no, Peter. That is not the mentality. We're going for positivity. No. Show is that it's open and a lot of people are going to show up. That is absolutely the sound of what is. What is desired is that all the corporate partners have an opportunity to come and rub elbows with the gm, which is gala. Which is g. Which can be gala. So what do we have on Thursday right now? Can we do corporate partners that day? Thursday is kind of just open right now. Community event. We do need. Jill needs to know now if we want to do a community event now before we have shoved it all on the same day. Yep. Then gala. That's what we did last year. And it's funny how we have all these great ideas at the beginning. We're gonna wind up right where we've done every year. Tried and true. We might as well just for the community event. The first things that brings them all together with the foundation event. I know one of the things that was brought up is assimilating bi. Kind of introducing them to everybody. Yeah. Now there's only three of them. I had it attached specifically with the corporate partners generation of like overall Westgate going into the GM con. But I'm just throwing it out there for consideration. We'll get a good feel for. There's only three of us going to theirs. Yeah. So we'll have a good. A better feel for it sometime after we go to their conference. Wait, did you book your flight? Did she book your flights yet? Yeah, same flights. Right. Well, I'm leaving from Pittsburgh that day because my son plays college football, so I'll be up there watching him play on Saturday. No, we're leaving on Sunday. I know I'm leaving Sunday from Pittsburgh, but I think we land. I think we all three land around the same time, hopefully. I don't want to ride by myself. I know you are like, oh, here's my flight. Okay, good. Hopefully she. Hopefully she looked at my flights and book tours around. No, there's only one flight. That's not a thing. All right, where are we now? Are we back to corporate partners on the day leading into the gala? Do we. Yeah. So we're looking at shifting corporate partners here. I'll have to adjust that timeline as well, which is no big deal. We actually don't need this either. I just missed. I missed that. Yeah, that was because we were coming from. That will buy your 120. There you go. So that's your 120 for corporate partners if we shift it here. That's right. Well, then all the corporate partners get to come to the award show, because. You go 2:30 to 4:30, and then. Is there a cocktail reception before the award show? Nichols? Yes. Okay, so they go corporate partners, cocktail party, award show. Yeah. Here's the specific schedule for the gala that we did. So. Yeah. Okay, so we'll shift corporate partners to Thursday. If corporate partners want to use a TV to present, I'm assuming we could just do it in the rooms. Right. Can you connect to them? We'll have to. Yeah, we'll just have to make sure everybody has HDMI cords. As long as they're not Westgate TVs. That's what I'm like. Because we used to have some TVs. That you couldn't plug anything into. Westgate TVs don't have that. We'll figure it out. Well, they be allowed to, like, move furniture as well, or should we kind of give them a, hey, here's what you can and can't do in a room. Make sure you be able to put it back. Take photos of, like, what, the standard setup? Well, it sounds like there's only going to be six rooms, right? No, no, they would only go the. Your GMs would only go to six of the rooms. How many rooms? I'm so confused. Okay, so we have 30 some listed right now. I don't think the GMs have to go to all of them. Even if we cut it down? No, even if we cut it down. I don't think they have to go to all of them. I thought in the app we could find a way where they select the six they want to go to. And then I could also create one page documents from each of the sessions to give to them after the conference. Like it's, I mean it's just like a conference. You can't. I think we need to do the vote thing that you talked about. And then top six get a room in all. And then we just rotate 15 minutes. You're gonna rotate 20 some GMs through those rooms a time. Well, you split the GMS up. Oh yeah. Okay, right. So maybe five, but only six partners out of that list of 33. Six groups. Yeah, it's. It's the time limit. It's the 15 minutes. We can cut down to eight minutes and double down. Right. I mean I wouldn't want two things. I wouldn't want, I wouldn't. I don't want some GMs getting one message from one group, but the others. I also don't want groups set, get all set up and nobody goes to their session. Well, I would do signups before. Like I would have the gms. Like from a logistical standpoint, I would have all the GM sign up for the sessions before that. The same thing as sending out the ranking and saying, hey, who do you want to hear from? Right. If we did groups of five, five GMs and they went to. They just rotated through the six rooms. That's going to give you your two hours. Yes. So we'd have a lot more room. We'd have a lot of rooms with nobody in them other than the presenters going, nobody came to see me. Well, there could be less GMs. Like each corporate partner could get a smaller number of GMs. How many do we have on that list? Which is still going to be 15 minutes per room. Correct. Which is only going to get to six rooms. Well, you don't have less than 15 minutes. I think that was just the wrong. Yeah, 15 minutes. The way I worked the logistics out the first time is 15 minutes per room. Each GM can go to six of how many ever rooms you have. So they get to pick the six rooms that they would go to. I guess to me that's the challenge is twofold there. One is not every general manager gets the information that the other general managers got. Two, we have corporate partners and nobody shows up to their room. Yeah, I would do A sign up. Like I would have forced the sign up prior to. And only a limited certain amount of spots per room per session. So GMs would have to go in and sign up. And once that room was full, they would have had to have pick a different one. So maybe they had, you know, eight or 10 different rooms they wanted to get to. They're gonna have to pick six to go to. And the corporate partners would have to give the same message every single time. Right. But not all the GMs are going to get to all the rooms. Correct. They're not all going to get the same messaging. But I would then create a one page document from each of those rooms from each of the groups. Then what I would do is I. Create whatever you want. Yeah. Rob, you have some thoughts? I mean, the corporate partners. Yes, we still have corporate. Rob's like, can we move on? Rob's already gone. No, I think he just. The way we actually. The way we did it last year with the rooms is fine. We didn't last year. We did a giant. Giant whole bunch of. But that's a giant. I think we just got to do. Do the chart, find the top six and invite the top six to do it. Yeah. Okay. Everybody else can show up at the gala. Yeah. Show up at the cocktail reception. That way, however many groups we have, they all move through all the rooms. They all get the same messaging and nobody gets offended. Hopefully on the corporate partner side that nobody showed up at their room. Wait, Walter's gallon. Oh, yeah. Okay. Somebody got that? Yes, I have my part. Yes, yes, I got it. Yes. Got it. I just don't want to show my notes to everybody. You know, Rob is wearing an ugly shirt today. Stuff like that. I like your shirt. All right. Okay. So that's back to how it's always been. Same as it ever was. Back to where it is. So that, that allows us to put something in there for the open slot for the opening. Rather, do you have a preference on Mitch or Jared on which day? Mitch. The first day. Mitch. First day. Okay. Mitch. Open day one. Got it. I'll adjust the timing. Does he need 90 minutes? I doubt it. But 45 screamed at me without a single sound. 45. Moving on. Yeah, yeah. 45 a plan. Okay. An hour. All right. Okay. Hopefully 45. Got it. Got it. Okay. So then we go into Rob's. What? Of leadership. Why? Of leadership. How of leadership. Right. Each of them similar format of last year has an activity block after it. And so those are the three sections. This is pretty cut and dry from last year, same format. And then from there, I'm proposing that panel that you guys thought about with John, Jared, Mitch, Richard, Bobby. I realized coming up here that that kind of requires Mitch to, like, either be there all day or then leave and come back. So I know that we could. We could look at that. Okay. So then I had. I had us blocked here for the panel for 75 minutes, and I don't really have a description for it, but. So this panel should be. So the whole day here is about leadership. So that panel should be about leadership. Right. So there's. We want to do a moderator. Yes. Right. To help drive. These should be more questions about leadership. There'd be questions. Richard be a great monitor. With Richard. Richard, the. The PR guy. Stephen. Stephen. She's. Robert. Okay. Sorry. Japan is so close. But, yeah, we want to keep that. Panel should be about leadership. You know, what are some leadership axioms that you live by? Like, keep it about leadership, not just open questions about anything going on in the. In Westgate. We want this to be a panel about being a leader. So day one is all about leadership. Okay. All right. So that kind of. Interestingly, the flow I had was kind of like Rob talking about leadership into the panel. And then Wednesday, we're now looking at overall Westgate leadership coming in. One of the concerns I have is this is a lot of talking happening here in the beginning. So that is a lot of talking. And I don't. I. I think we talked. I don't see what we're putting in the third pillar of team member. We're talking. We said we wanted. We are down here at the bottom. Team member engagement. Not satisfaction. Team member engagement. And we want to talk about leadership. So day one is leadership. Day two needs to be about team member engagement. Yes. Okay. I had all these as notes, as people that you wanted to come in and speak. Do you think the panel. Okay, we'll get rid of that. All right. This. This to me is L and D. This is hr. Okay. This is any of the big departments that. That touch a lot of team members. Okay. So that. That actually fits really well. Because I was thinking that right after. We'll move this up. But I was thinking right after lunch, you open up on how and why we take care of our teams and how we hit that pillar. And then from there, that was the open slots of, like. There's no activity in there. Not yet. So this. We just haven't. This is just. Yeah, we haven't. We gotta. We gotta flush this out. Yeah, yeah. This is rough. Rough. So. So, you know, the good part of that is we'll need to then just talk about what these sessions are. Well, Jared stays. Right. But what. These sessions are highlighted. That's a good day for Jared because he oversees all those. Those L and D oversees hr. Okay. What other departments really touch how we grow and develop our team members. I would almost say. Hold on just to that. To this point of this being a whole like People and Culture Day is what it sounds like. We just take them out of the corporate partners scheduling if the GMs are going to hear from us all day. This day. Yeah, that's a good point. And then that gives you guys out. Yeah. And give yourselves time here. Trisha. Jill. Okay. Yep. Trisha, that's another one. Recruiting. Yeah. I'm saying. Yeah. Okay. Culture. Who's on that committee? It's not a committee. It's not a department. People in Culture, there's a. There's a team member engagement committee. Yeah. Committee. That's. No, no, no, no, no. I'm sorry. So that's a department, people. And Culture is a department. And in that department it's L&D. HR, Talent Acquisition, Foundation, Payroll. There's your. That those four fill this day. Okay. Okay. I do have a question about leadership. And Alex, I'm taking notes everywhere right now. Okay. I'm sorry, I thought you told me. But maybe not. I don't see. And Rob, maybe this is in there somewhere, but those 12 competencies. That's the how. That's the how. Okay. Okay. I want to go through all the 12. Okay. Okay. So I haven't finalized that from the notes yet because I have notes from a ton of you. So as soon as I finalize it, I'll send it over to you. Okay. And so we're going to cover what they are and like what that looks like moving forward. Right. And then there's going to be a longer term plan of training them on and getting them up to competency because we wouldn't be able to do it here. Right. Okay. Okay. Just making sure. Okay. Okay. Know how do you apply it? And then the activity. Okay. Okay. Is gonna. And then, you know, on Wednesday when we're talking, we can still weave some leadership into the People in Culture Day. Well, definitely talk about, you know, what does that lattice work look like? How do I move my career performance and all that. Performance. Exactly. Okay. But I would also do all, you know, I'd do some covey in there. I do some, some different well known le People engagement. Because I I know Rob will fill his day, but I think there's a lot of other good learnings, you know, 21 laws. Did you finish reading 21 laws of irrefutable Leadership? Isn't that the one I gave you? No, I gave you how that happened? I gave you. How did that happen? But yeah, like 21 laws is a good one. How did that happen? Is a good one. Did you look at that? Yep. Or these are titles. These are all books. How did that happen and what it's all. And 21 laws. 21 irrefutable laws and Leadership. Okay. But it's more about how you grow and develop leaders, but also how do we care for team members? Okay. You know, we should probably get a little, you know, the. The pizza party. Everybody sees through the pizza party, right? Yeah, everybody sees through the pizza party. That's how we know it's time for tea set. Well, I was gonna say, when's tea set? September. It's gonna be very different survey. So we'll already. We'll have action plans. Will be in 30 days. Yeah. Something I wanted to do, but I think we're moving the People and Culture Summit. So we were going to have the People and Culture Summit in November. And an activity I wanted to do with that whole group is map out the full candidate journey pre all the way to exit, and then have each group map out where they touch points and then overlay them on top of each other so you can see where there's overlap. Then as a people and culture team build out, where should all those touch points be? And then at the GM conference, we could have brought that exercise and talked about here's where all these touch points are, but here's where GMs you and your leaders, like, these are your touch points. Right. Like, what is a GM's touch point for pre employment? And then what is their touch point for. For someone. We just had this come up. Someone relocating. Right. Like, what's the touch point for the property level on someone relocating and getting their reservation? That's very. Getting very granular. But that's something that literally just happened, so. And I don't know if people in culture can somehow still do that exercise before this if we don't have our summit. But yeah, I mean, that'd be good. You know, there's so much in this space. Right, Right. There's so much in the space about interacting with our team members, how we're growing, how we're developing, how we're. How we're disciplining, how we're coaching. Right. Okay. Right. There's all those. You know, we are. I don't think we're comfortable having meaningful dialogue about performance, especially if it's negative. If it's poor performance. Yep. Like we'd rather just ignore it than we would confront it. Okay. So one of the randos I had come up that I can't quite find where it fits is you've mentioned wanting to talk about complexity modeling. Do you want to leave that in there? Still not. I don't think it fits here now, but do you want it in the context somewhere? What do we have? Thursday. It's Thursday. Going to be the usual. Get up, go to a charity event, come home, get. Get cleaned up. It was going to change, but we talked ourselves back. Yeah. And the truth is we got to roll that out before the end of the year. Complexity modeling. So do you want. So back to Thursday for a second? Oh, go ahead. You finish your. Before the end of the year. Then you were saying, take it out of here. Yeah. Okay. Okay. We got to get that done and. Okay, so we do. So we do. Plane. 17 hours. Oh, do we just lose. Filled. Just drop. No, I'm still here. Okay. That was a weird noise. That was a very weird noise. I was like, oh, no, no. So we do want a volunteer event. Yes, yes. Off site somewhere. Okay. What did we just do? We. What did we just do? We had a great one. I'm sorry you missed it. It was really. Yeah. The kids. I heard about the kids. Right. It was. It was very good. Lot of fun. But it wouldn't be big enough for all of us to go to it. But something like that, like, you really felt good. Okay. That you made a difference in those. Kids lives that one day. Okay. I know we do a lot of work with Neores. How far would that be from the Villas? The what? The children's hospital in Lake Nona. Yeah. It's like Nona wouldn't be too bad, right? To shuttle back and forth, but there's a lot they do. I mean, like the LND team were doing something with them in October, so it's a lot of. Okay. I don't want to go clean up a homeless shelter again. Okay. Got it. So mean. And I know you didn't mean it like that, but, you know, you were. In the back of the kitchen. You made Omar and I go front and center. We were on the front line. You guys had to serve everybody. Oh, I just. That's why I just. I'm like, I'm not gonna look I'm just writing what he's got it noted. Yeah. The last one we did was not my favorite. I felt like they were like, and now we're serving meals three times a day, seven days a week. And I thought, well, why would anybody go get a job? I remember them distinctly saying, like, come back in four hours. And we have lunch. Then four hours after that, we have dinner. This is not a bad cake. This is not a bad gig. We're all going to hell with Peter. Okay, moving on. All right, so the only thing we need to do is from our side, we need to come back with corporate partner stuff. We need to come back with a plan for Wednesday with our HR partners and then anything else from our side, not answer. There's two days of coursework, if you will, or participation. And Thursday. It's nice to have that break. I mean, I know we tried to do something different this year. Do something like to go for them breakfast. Depending on when they're leaving. I'll get flight schedules. I'll make sure that the flight accommodation. Yes, I remember that. We delivered their coffee and breakfast to their room. I like that. Again, I'll get flight itineraries and have everything listed out for you so you know who's leaving when they're leaving. And then if they're there, we can do like a hang, meet us, and dead drafts. For dead drafts. I'll be done going to the Village by Friday. I can't with you today. He's going home Thursday night, and you will not see him on Friday. He's not coming in on Friday. So we do have all the rooms. Faith took care of that. All of the rooms are booked. I saw Business Travel already in inventory, started working on that list. So we have holds for F and B. Nicole, we have, I think three or four rooms held for you guys. Maybe four. And then we have some extra holds as well. So we did hold a couple extra rooms just in case we needed them for anybody else, but. Yeah, but you've got all the breakouts, like, I don't know we really talked about that yet. All the breakout sessions. Our breakout. Is it called breakout? Rolling Breaks. Rolling Breaks, yeah. Yeah, we'll have that. That's. That's anything that he has breaks. And typically we'll go back and forth on that to say, like, hey, can we pivot this 15 minutes down? Or whatnot? Because sometimes he'll have an actual break, but then my food break will be a different time. And then we'll just roll it in during an activity or Something. Yep. Field will count on you to once again emcee the. Yeah. Basically kick off every day with a rousing hello and a. And then a. A wonderful job at the gala, as you always do. I appreciate it, Peter. Looking forward to it. Excellent. Excellent. We're very excited. This year we'll be giving away the Crystal Pineapple Awards. So that will be. We're gonna. I want those just. We're way early to say this, but I don't. I want those all covered on the stage so nobody sees them until we pull the top off of it and we present the first Crystal Pineapple Award. And we'll talk about, you know, how it's a traveling award. You know, each year we'll ship it to the winning location and ship it back to be given away the next year. Have you started putting thought into what awards you're going to give out this year? Are we going to mirror the same awards as last year to keep. I have not. In fact, if I could get the awards we did last year, I'd like to look at it. I'll send that over then, Peter. I can bring that next time we have our meeting, too. I know last year the financial award was really soft because I occupancy was so crazy that she unfortunately is no better. I don't have the financial. We're not shaking Peter and Rob down and made point for you guys, too on that one since we work in the same office. On which one? Kalisa. What's that, Calista? So they don't have to worry as much about it. Yeah, Y. Just corner you at lunch. You know where to find us. I will take your fork and take. Know where to find us. Right. Any swag conversations? I don't know, Phil. Do you want to cover swag this time or are we good until. I mean. No, we're good until next time. No updates right now, okay? Field, where are you? Take a guess. Oh, we'll play the game then. Hold on. Let's look at some artwork. What do we think? Where are we? That looks like either Mesa. Ah, good guess. KP got it on the first one. As soon as she saw the picture, she's like Mesa. I also looked at the size of the room and the doll. Dreary brown couch. And the dreary brown. Sounds about right up, boy. Yeah. Shorts looking good. Scores are up. The raw score is challenging. Okay. We have anything else? Are we good? I feel like we're getting more structure. So. We are. Look, as Rob saw yesterday in our famous branding meeting up till now everything about branding has been sitting around speaking conceptually, and I have been miserable at every single meeting and had nothing to say yesterday. I thought I'd have nothing to say. And they actually put slides up with thoughts and suggestions. And I was like, you couldn't shut me up yesterday. It was like, got it. Now Alex said it was a very interesting meeting with nine drastically different ideas. Not nine drastically. Nine ideas. Like three. There's definitely three camps. There's definitely three camps. Nice Hunger Games that you guys will be. Oh, how can we do a Hunger Games? That'd be fun. That would be fun. That would be fun. To do something big out in the field. I feel dressed as Caesar. What's that? Have feel dressed as Caesar from the movie. I already have the outfit ready. Don't worry. Feels like I'm in to the final. Don't give me that idea. Because that would be really fun. There is a giant field out there to do something. That's for sure. We've done a lot of fun things out there. Oh, camp Catch on. Peter, were you there? No. It was the one year we had them all blindfolded and they had to make animal noises to find what group they were part of. And then nobody wanted to do it. But we were going to have One of the GMs just be on their own, like. Like a giraffe or something. I was like. And I was like, no, Phil, we cannot do this. We can still do that. We try to do it to Clay. I'm like, I'm not trolling Clay. This will not end well for any of us. We still have time. Not doing B.O. on the floor. We don't really have any activities like that right now. I know. Tug of war. You could do field day. Field. You could do field day. And you can be in charge. I'll be more than happy. Dollars. Fields Field Day. Just call it Fields Day. Fields Day. Fields Day. Could we do that before? Could we do that before they do their dinners with their regionals? And could you break them into regions? Like, could you break them into regions and, like, one region actually has to win? And then that's capture the flag kind of thing. Yeah. And whichever regional, region against region, whichever region wins, also gets to pick if they go to SIDS or los. Like, they get. They get first. They get first pick. They get first pick. First pick on the restaurant. Yeah. You know, River Branch has the. The gel tech thing. They actually have a. Yes. That's what capture the flag kind of game set up. Just a thought. You know those Things don't hurt. And they. They're. You know, we could be referee. You mean at River Ranch. But you could bring it to us. Like, they. They can just bring it. They can bring all the stuff. I'm just trying to think of collegiate tug of war. You could do all those things. Yeah, Sack races. Sack races. Not back scratching keg stands. I was thinking more frat party ideas, but as my son is rushing frat and I'm like, oh, my gosh, I'm terrified. I'd love to be a guest in that building. Just looking down at us playing these. Games, you know, do we have. Can you go. For sure. Can you go back to the schedule really quick? During fields day, we can get shirts for everyone. I think if the more creatives in here put their heads together, they come up with a lot of fun stuff. Stuff to do on fields. We need to have like a. Outside of Florida and put like a. Stacy. Chuckles. Yeah. Team names. Yeah. And let them like. His name is evolving. Chuckles. Well, I don't want to tell you what I accidentally called him, so. Sure. I'm not the only one. Brett. King Charles. King Charles. Brett knew Brett for a while. No, don't call me. I actually, yeah, I accidentally said King Charles and I was like, oh, my God, it's Charles. Charles King Jesus. Jesus. It's like, cannot do that to his face. All right, well, I don't know where you're gonna fit fields day in here. But we're gonna fit it in the day before they do their regional dinners. We'll figure it out, whichever day that becomes. So we'll have to tell them, hey, bring athletic gear for. Regional dinner. Should be this day. Then I just need to see what else is going on out in Orlando because it's. The Magic just released their schedule because I know you're looking for that. Yeah. Do they play then? Yeah. There's one night we'll go out. Do you want to see if they have a game that week? Yeah. Any thoughts on sports? Solar bears Would not. We. We've looked that up before. They're not still playing at that point, are they? Do you have a meeting with Mitch in two minutes? Oh, yeah, we got a meeting. Thank you. All right. You're welcome. I will be back with us from Puerto Vallarta. Yes. You and I had picked the same flight. Okay. That 12 o' clock flight. Yes. Garrett is not flying back with us. He picked a 6am flight home that morning. Something about his wife and needing to get. I don't know. So. But yeah, we fly home. The only home game the week of the 20th, 26th is that Friday the 30th. Oh, okay. Well, that doesn't work. I know. That always happens. Bye, Phil. Thank you. Have a great day. Have a great day. Oh, people are coming in. Yeah, Solar bears doesn't have.","📅 **Meeting Overview**:

Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah. So we're getting there and I think the on the job training checklist for onboarding and whatnot is going to be a huge driver for that. I think you were copied in some of the recent emails. So for house person and runner, I think there were some ADP and like some title things. So we haven't been able to launch those yet. But on 91 we are going to be launching the public area attendant checklist that I was working with Kat and Aspen and Michelle on. So that one we decided we don't want to hold off any longer. Like we'll, we'll go ahead and launch that one, but once the ADP stuff gets situated and the job title stuff gets situated, we'll be able to launch the other one. So I think I reached out to Lisa, I believe Steph did, and I think the last update we got is that it hasn't been changed yet or updated yet. So once you guys know, let us know and we can launch those other checklists. Okay. If you can forward the public area one to me. I have not seen that one, but I have seen the other one and voice, voice some of my, my suggestions on some of those. So they were working on making something else change. Just happens that every time that call happens with them, I'm either at the villas that were at the lakes, which is great. I'm like, okay, hey, great. Yeah, yeah. I don't plan, it just happens. And I'm like, okay, yeah, definitely, yeah, yeah. So, and, and then any other ones that are being worked on, you know, just please, you know, loop me in so that way I can, I can make sure, you know, we're, we're just consistent. And that's the big thing is being consistent across the board. Absolutely. Yeah. The last thing I just thought of, I know chemicals has been a thing that we're kind of waiting on. So Steve has a really cool micro learning template where he was showing each of the chemicals. So I think the last update I got on that, I think it was something over in the hate saying this procurement, procurement side where they, they really wanted to have the same housekeeping chemicals at all of the properties. And so I think Pat had mentioned most of them could. I might be misspeaking here, but I think Vegas might have been the one or some of the, like the properties out west where they were like, we're not sure if we can get that same chemical out there to use in their housekeeping. So we're ready to try to Jump into that. But I think the last thing we just need is to know the final set of chemicals. And I know that that was something they were working on, so. So if you hear any updates, be sure to let us know. And I know procurement is working on that, and it should be a brand standard across the company. So there shouldn't be. On the west coast with getting. Ain't there as many hotels over there use the same, you know, products and stuff, you know, And I know that, like, some of the big companies Equal Lab, they provide a lot of these training videos too, you know, honor. Okay. So, you know, that's something that, if that's who we go with, it's partnering with them to say, hey, you know, instead of recreating the wheel, let us borrow your train. You know, we can implement them into our stuff. And I know they do a lot of that. They'll do a lot of that on site training as well, for us to make sure everybody's using those chemicals appropriately. They know the SDs behind them, they know the functions and all that as well. So once. Once that gets finalized and I know the work on final details of all that, we can. We can roll those out and get that done. Okay. Yeah, that's great. And if, you know, if you're familiar that they have any videos or anything already, that. That would save us a lot of time. Right? Yeah. So definitely. Definitely let us know about that. Yeah, no, definitely. Definitely. Thank you. Awesome. Well, that's all for me. I guess we'll pass it over to Alex. Yeah. Alex, are you good? I know that you might have to step away for a second. No, I should be okay to go ahead and talk a little about it. So. So nice to meet you, Richard. I know we talked a little bit on the call just a second ago. Well, indirectly. Right. About some of the influence we try to have on the operations. So I handle the training delivery side. So what that means is once Adam's team is done creating it, my team will then take over and deliver it. So that's on general topics that we create or things that are prescribed, things like that. But ultimately, we also oversee the CFT program. And the CFT program is probably our biggest chance to influence the area. And I will say transparently, right off the bat, we haven't always had the best partner in your position in this area. So hearing the standardization, wanting to do everything the same, like, you are screaming our language. So really looking forward to kind of partnering with you on these. We're not doing bad in housekeeping. But I think we can get more cfts, and my team will be driving that right to, you know, and also working with you closely on that, on how we do that and what's going to be this kind of standard. We have a pretty set standard, but ultimately working with you on, like, what kind of people are you looking for? Like, did you hear of anybody great in the property that we could reach out to? Right. Like, things like that. And also vice versa, we'll share with you, like, hey, this person's really strong. You know, we do want to see them as a cft. Their leader did come forward. But. And so ultimately, once that happens, we then can ensure that that standardized training is put across the board. And the cfts are now trained on checklists. That's relatively new. Right. As you came in, as Adam was saying. And so that helps us, like, ensure, to your point, like, they were trained on this date, on this task, and we know that they were told the correct thing. Right. Because you mentioned, I heard you mention earlier, like, oh, we know you were trained the right way, but now you're doing it in your own way. And, and that probably is happening a lot of the same way. But I don't know that I could confidently answer until these checklists came in, like, hey, were they training the right way? So, you know, we're pushing up our influence, and you heard me on the GM call, like, we're making them, making more use of that. That time they were very underutilized, you know, coming in, and we could have done more and more. So I've been back home just over a year, and now we're really pushing, like, to get the most out of them to be the best partner for you and the GMs, and just making sure. Right. And it kind of benefits all of us. So I'm really excited. You know, we had great partners in the past, but not always the best partner on the CFT aspect of it. So really looking forward to that. And it's. And, you know, and, and, and it's that of, you know, that consistency and holding those CFTs, you know, accountable, making sure that, you know, the 30, 60, 90, you know, is accomplished. Okay, where are you at 30 days after your training? Where you at 60 days after your training? Where are you at 90 days, you know, after training? And, you know, to me, big vision would be, you know, we use a heck of a lot of contract labor out there, you know, and a good portion of it is consistent people that come, you know, and, and there's a small portion of it that it's, you know, it's, it's, you know, you're swapping out today for tomorrow and things like that. But, you know, are they following our standards? Are they following our expectations? Are they following, you know, our needs and you know, what we're expecting of them training wise as well? I know, you know, some people say it's a lot of training dollars, it's a lot of time invested to, to get them up in training because they don't stay for long periods of time. But the expectation needs to be there for them as well. You know, an expectation needs to be there that they're accomplishing and doing their job as well. But you know, CFT's out there are, are key for you. You know, they're, they're, they're your trainers. They're the ones that are going to teach, coach, develop your, your, your, your next leaders, you know, and your next people that are going to be successful. So, so excited about that, you know, excited about, you know, what you were talking about in the GM call with, you know, with, with what Omar created and stuff and excited to see that go and, and move and, and add in housekeeping to it because that would be great, great tracking as well for it. And I covered front description on that call. But we do have a housekeeping one that we're starting to roll out and kind of test. So you know, I can try to give with Omar to get a copy of that over to you and just make sure it kind of, we generally make it along with the checklist that we've created. So if there are any changes to that, we can get ahead of that and just kind of make sure that we're observing for the right things and you know, if you identify something over this last quarter that, you know, hey, I'm noticing they're, they're spraying too close to the surface and it's bouncing back, you know, too much. Right. We can add that to the observation and say, okay, you know, over the next quarter we'll specifically look for that behavior. So that'll be really exciting too. Okay. Okay. Yeah. And I know, you know, I know one of the big topics I had earlier today was bedbugs, you know, and it's, it's, it's one of those you hate talking about, but you got to talk about it and you know, what's the training out there for it and yeah, we train you when you get hired in, but you know, you're a 20 year employee. Are you still understanding and understanding how, how Vital, that is to a company. And you know, to me that should be a quarterly or six month training. You know, that it's like a sexual harassment, like a, you know, you know, those kind of trains that you do it every year to remember what you're doing and making sure we're hitting those, you know, those expectations and you know, bed bugs can take you down, man. They can take a whole property down if, if you're not careful. Oh, for sure. It'll impact, impact the brand pretty heavily of that property. Yeah, sure, I know. The reason I'm glad we were going to capture that point is I know you had that pest control person on the thread that we were talking about earlier, but I was hoping to get ahead of it because we do have an E learning and that's probably better in kind of Adam's area because I don't know where it's at from a review perspective, but there is an E learning related to that aspect. So I just want to make sure we got on the conversation about that and if we needed to give you a preview of it and kind of see what maybe plans we could work on with Adam's team. Yeah, no problem. I'd love to see that and love to see, you know, what that's all about. Because like I said, it's, it's, it's key that we're doing it. And you know, like I asked the question on the call I had earlier today, is it more contract labor? Is it more our staff? And it sounds like it's more contract labor. Well, let's, let's, let's hold these guys accountable, make sure they're following, they should be following our same expectations. You know, we spent a lot of money on these guys. And Richard, I guess I would ask about contract labor because this is. In the seven years I've been here, this has gone back and forth many of times. But my understanding of contract labor is that it is not our responsibility to train contract labor. It is contract labor's team's responsibility to train their own teams on our standards. And, and, and, and that is correct. Okay, but are they doing that and are they training them? You know, and, and, and who's, who's doing the checks and balances on them? Right. You know, to say they are training and they are training them correctly or they just brought 10 people off the street that. You know what I'm saying? Yep. Yeah, I get where you're coming from. And it's who's, who's doing the checks and balances for Them. Okay. You know? Okay. Do we have them sign off and say, yeah, they've been Westgate trained and they know the Westgate standards and expectations, and if they come in, they screw something up, then it's. It's. It's on them, you know. And. And things like that. Because it's more and more going out there, talking to resorts. That's where the issues are coming from. Okay. You know, and this time of year when we're so slow, we should have less contract labor, more of our employees, and give them the hours and let them work. All right. If I did this correctly, I think I just assigned you the bedbug course in the lms. If I did it correctly, it's usually something Alex would probably do or Adam, but I think I did it right. I'm sure you did. Yeah. If you don't see it, Richard, just let me know and I can take a look. I'm trying to think of other housekeeping items we have. Are you able to do the floor cleaning as well? Stuff. I think that's another one. Is it? Or are those does who does the floor cleaning for some. I can look that up for some reason. I didn't know. I don't know that that was specific to. I see floor safety. Floor safety. That's the one. Floor safety. How tos. Okay. Yeah, that one. I don't know. I'm trying to look that one up and see. I don't know who that's assigned to. I don't know how to tell. Alex, do you know how to. I. I'm not good on this side of the lms. I'm looking. Yeah, I'm looking into that now. You said floor safety. Okay. So. Yeah, Richard, that. That bedbug one is already in the lms. I don't know what the cadence is. Alex would be able to look and see, like, what the cadence is as far as. Is if. Is it assigned on higher, and then is it reassigned at any point? I do not believe it's reassigned at any point at this time. And that course has been around for a while, so if there is, you know, an opportunity for us to improve it. Adam, could we find the Scorm file? Yeah, we could. I could see if we have the file still. Let me verify that. Okay. If we have the Scorm file still, we could put it in a review link for you, Richard, and we could send it to you. We could even send it to, like, Pat, Michelle, Aspen, and you guys could all put comments in the review and, like, give specific feedback on slides specifically that you would want to see change. But yeah, that's definitely something that we would have to kind of look into a little bit further and give you see if we have that SCORM file. Some of these were created by old instructional designers and we don't have those files. So it's pulling up for me now. So I got it. I'm looking at it. Okay. To begin the course. Perfect. Yep. I'll look through it and. And go through there. Yeah, I just, I, you know, to me, that's. That, that's a hot topic. Okay. You know. Okay. And that's one that just needs to be reinforced. The procedure as well. I know going through procurement, it's. It's funny because they, they look at the usage on it, you know, and the usage on the chemical. And the usage on the chemical is very low right now, you know, so my question is, are you really using what you're supposed to be using to do the job? You know, and that's where, you know, that's where my mind goes and says, yeah, you know, it's an extra chemical for you and you just don't want to carry it. So. Okay, makes sense. Yeah. Well, we'll see if we'll find the review360 link, because if you want to be able to give feedback, that's going to be easier. I know you have access in the LMS now, but. And then, Alex, let's also find out how often that course is assigned. Is there any Richard data currently on any type of bedbug reports that we have? Like, are we seeing an increase or a spike over the last like 30, 60, 90 days of any type of increase? Or are you looking at the data from the perspective of. I just don't see the chemical being used as much, so I just want to know. So that way, if we. When we move in this direction. Right. And we say right now it's only assigned once a year, but we're going to move into this direction of it being signed quarterly or however it is you want to assign. Looks like the course says it's 25 minutes right now, I imagine. Adam, I don't know if you know, but it's probably a rough estimate, so we probably would need to figure out the right estimate on what that is. But I want to be able to see that if we are assigning it that much and we're spending that much time to take the course, are we reducing the number of bedbug incidents being reported or are we using the chemical more Right So like what are those data points that you're looking at? And I know the. So the reason all this started was there was a spike and the calls and the spike for the number of calls was, was Lakes, Myrtle Beach, Cocoa beach, you know, in Vegas were the top ones that the spike was in. So then my question was, you know, okay, we use a chemical for what's the chemical usage? And then the report came out and the usage was very low. And I was like, okay, well then that's a concern to me because if it is low, you know, and, and, and we're spiking. Yeah, great. It's slow right now. But you know, and then my question was, what are we doing training wise? You know, is this, you know, of course that we do all time. What's the SOP on it? You know, so I got the SOP today on it. I've got the training. So you know, it's something that we need to keep on radar and keep on radar all the time. Okay. It's also something. And Alex, to see your hands up. But like you say you have a spike in these four properties right now, like we could even read. Alex, you're going to have to correct me on this if there's something not right here. But I do think we can push out just to those four properties for them to retake the course. And then you could also. You should. And I don't know if you KP set this up for you yet, but you should have access to review reporting for the entire housekeeping department across the organization. So, so. That was going to be. My next question was do I have access to bill view that they are completing the training and where they at? Because that is something that I want to be able to talk about on my national call as well. You know that I do and say, hey, you know, our usage is low. You guys are saying everybody's completing the training, but you know, my numbers don't match up, you know, or the train low and the usage is low. Well, that makes sense. Why you, you know, you're spiking. Yeah, things like that. Of course. Yeah. Alex, do you have something? Yeah, I got, I got five to run through there. I captured five. So yes, we will set up your view as there's a national director view where you'll be able to see everybody across the entire company probably except Vegas in like in housekeeping. But obviously that can be fixed. Big Vegas though. Big Vegas. Yeah, the casino. And so that if that hasn't been set up, then she'll probably set that up in there near future and we can follow up on that. Number two, yes. We can push the training out to certain properties, even certain departments, even certain jobs. So we can go all the way down if we need to. We could target a housekeeper job at Flamingo Bay in Vegas if we need to. So yeah, we could do that. Number three, actually, I'll combine the last few bed bugs. Floor safety are both assigned to housekeeping and they are one time assignments, so. So they don't recur. That I can see. But KP will be the ultimate expert on that. But then I can see it doesn't recur, but we can always update that. I don't know the complexities of that, but that's more of a KP1. But we can investigate that if that's where the direction we want to go. Yeah, yeah, I'd like to go that way. And I'd start right now. Probably do it once every six months, so twice a year, you know, deploy it out and then I guess. And I probably know the answer to this question, but I guess my next question will be, you know, the big topic, you know, how do we track what contract labor is doing, you know, on this? Do. I know it's their job to make sure the training's done, but is there a way of tracking that they're getting this training as well. So contract labor would not end up in our LMS because they're not in adp. So everything's automated is to the degree we can automate it on our side. Right. And so I'm sure there's some type of way. I just think we might have to get creative. Alex, I saw you unmute. Were you going to say the same thing or did you have something else? Yeah, word for word what you're going to say. Except for the last part because the last part is extremely manually intensive. But we can't. There are workarounds that can be done upending whatever contracts, things happen. But I think Steph mentioned that a little earlier. That's where our peers have always come in. But. But there's always a way. I will say that. Well, I was gonna say, depending on what it is. Alex and Adam, we can also. We can offline about this. Maybe there's a way you could be creative that's not in the lms because I know the LMS is very labor intensive, but I imagine they're using hot sauce devices, right, Richard? Yes, yes. So they're using hot sauce devices. They're getting hot sauce logins. Yeah. Hot sauce has checklist. So maybe there's, I don't know, just thinking outside the box, like, is there a way. I mean, this has always been. This has been a reoccurring, ongoing issue. Right. Last. The whole time I've been at Westgate. So, yeah, I don't know if there's a way to, you know, you share this video and put them in a room, have them watch the video and then they sign off and that checklist gets, you know, upload. So I, you know, I, I don't know. I'm, you know, old school. It's the way we used to do it is, hey, put them all together. You know, someone logs into their, you know, training, shows them video, and then everybody signs off that they watched it. You know, it's a way to kind of knock them all out in a quick aspect. But you guys are the experts on that, not me. Is there any. Anything in the contract with our. With that them that says there's certain things we can and can't do when it comes to that? I don't know. Okay. I don't know. Honestly, I haven't, I haven't dived into the contract check. Okay. So that. Lisa, at least a question I need to ask. It's always been some, some of my understanding is that while they should be doing it, it's like that we don't want to take the liability of doing it to some degree. Right. I think is where all that's come from. Like, I've been through a projects with different things and, and I recall also the name tag issue. Right. Like, we didn't want them wearing a name tag that had a Westgate logo because ultimately then we take liability for them if something happens. So there was like a lot of liability things that came out of the whole training, which is why we've kind of steered as clear as possible from it. But if you can find out any of that information and just give it back to us, I think the team can find ways that we could be creative. And then in the data points that you're pulling, is the increase that you're seeing from those four properties, is there a way for those calls for us to be able to decipher if contract labor or Westgate was in the room? It was contract labor. Okay. I asked that question. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah. And that was my question was on those spikes and those housekeepers, was it. Was it our team or was it a contract labor? And they said they were all contract labor. Okay. Which. That's where my you know, and, and I understand where you come from, you know, legally and, and things, but that's where my concern comes in. And my next question was, okay, if I'm compensating a guest, if, if I've got pest control coming out and now we're losing revenue on this room, you. Know, are we charging back contract labor? Yeah, yeah. Are we charging them back? Because this is, you know, it. That is a way for me to say, hey, you need to be on the, on your game, you know, about what we're doing, you know, and, and, and our expectation stuff. And, you know, part of the answer was yes, part of the answer was no. And some properties are doing it, some aren't. And I'm like, okay, we're, you know, you get hit on one end, but you're not getting hit on the other. So, you know, that's, that's, that, that's a question I need to find out as well get an answer for. Because, you know, truthfully, you know, if you own a contract labor company, apdc, and I'm going hand you a hundred times, you know, for this at an expense, you know, a thousand bucks a time or more, you know, you're going to feel it at some point. Yes. Do we know, are those rooms inspected? Are. Do they. Do they self inspect their own rooms? Or are they also. Do they self inspect. Are they inspected by APDC or are they inspected by us? As far as I understand, they're inspected by apdc, by whatever contract labor company it is. Okay. Yeah. And that might be the next level is then, you know, we need to start inspecting the contract labor and, you know, and, and things like that. You know, one of the questions came up this on my call today was, you know, is there another level of inspection that our housekeepers can do? Like, you know, instead of lifting the mattress, you gotta slide it anyways, you know, to, to tuck the sheet in, you know, can you, in that training put in there, say, okay, make sure you slide the sheet out and check, you know, behind it for, you know, for those bedbugs, you know, not have to lift it because they are heavy and we don't want you to, you know, to hurt yourself and, you know, in that, that liability. But, you know, that's. I, that question was what I asked, and that's. That's where my concern comes up. Okay. Yeah. I think if you could get us some more information, I saw both Adam and Alex on me too, but if you could just get us some more information on the contract, I think we could toss around some ideas and then. Adam, did you have something? Yeah, I was just gonna ask Alex, is there a way? I don't really know how to do it. I mean, I'm sure I could figure it out, but I just don't want to break anything. Can we assign the housekeeping checklist to Richard? They are in production. I just want to have him see, like, what from a front end use end user would see. Yeah, and they're all ready to go, like, public areas in there. But the other ones, I think we're just waiting on, like, the title clarification in adp. But I just want to give you an opportunity to be able to see, like, what the team member will see. Yeah, I can take care of that right now. Okay. And then I did confirm with kp. Richard, you do have access to all housekeeping. Now, the expert that would have to show you how to look at all that is Alex Moats, because I don't know how to look at all of that, but. What was that again? I missed that. I said he does have. He does have National Director access to all of housekeeping, but you would be the expert in showing him how to, like, look at some of those dashboards, like, look at compliance, like, see. See how many people have completed checklists. And so ultimately, Richard, once we launch, fully launch the checklist for on the job training, you would be able to go in there and see, like, have these new hires completed it, have their CFTs checked off on it and all of that. So you're going to be able to kind of oversee housekeeping in all of those different things. So perfect. And, you know, my, my ultimate goal on that would be, you know, I come from Master Corp, okay, Master Corp. Part of our QA inspection is we inspect. We. You get inspected on that as well. So you come in and they pull up your training, okay, is everybody complete or all your checklists done or are you, you know, and if they're not, you get marked off and you get graded on that, you know, and that's how I held my teams accountable for making sure training was done, making sure that their checklist. And then you hire paperwork was done and, and you know, we weren't missing anything. It was part of your qa, right? QA came in and they audited you and you didn't pass it. Why? This is the most important thing out there, you know, training. I love that. Sounds like Peter's inspect what you expect, right? Is that what he says? Inspect what you expect? Yeah, yeah, Yep, yep. And I talked to Field about it, and Field's on board with it, you know, and stuff. So I told him, I said, let me just understand more of the process. And then we can, you know, we can look at it and possibly add it in there. And it's, you know, you hold people accountable for what they're doing, and that's the best way to do it. And then we can all go back and look and say, okay, you know, so and so has been in 100 or so and so is, you know, here. And why aren't we doing the training? I. I'd love to toss an ignorant question out there. I always talk to Faith. I mean, not Faith. I was looking at Faith's message to me. Pat. I always. I was talking to Pat a couple weeks ago about kind of the contractors and stuff. And it. I couldn't tell. She. I wasn't sure for sure if I'm remembering this inaccurately, but I thought we billed them by the rooms that we asked them to clean, or is it by the number of hours we bill out? Like, do we bill the number of hours that we needed that day by person, or do we bill out the number of rooms? So they get paid piece rate. So they get. Build by the number of rooms. Hold on. Bill in them. Yeah. Billing them is by the hour. They get paid by the room that they clean. So the company pays them by the room, but we bill them by that. Okay, gotcha. That was. I remember Impact. That must be why I remembered it confusingly, because that she explained probably the exact same thing. And so I was like, well, how can we not just inspect the room and if it doesn't pass, they don't get paid. But. But I was like. And she was like, you don't understand. I was like, okay, all right, I got you. When Pat tells me I don't understand, I just back out. That's the. That's the rule run here. I think it's different in Smokey though, right? I think Smokey. We do pay them by the room. Yeah. Like, we actually pay the contract company by the room. That. Because it's cabin. I don't know. It's very. Smokey's also like that super weird one. Yeah. They're like 70 plus. There are a lot of contracts. I don't understand how we can't convert them to team members. I'll be out there next week. So I got a lot, a lot, a lot I'm looking at out there. So. Okay, well, anything you hear or any feedback you have from Us or any help or support you need from us, please reach out, please let us know. Adam and Alex, they're. They're the experts in the sides of the business that they run for learning. So, you know, feel free. Alex's team is all out on the site, so you'll have trainers out there that are not CFTs but training specialists that are on his team. So when you go to Smokey, you might meet Danny. So Danny's a training specialist out there and I know she's helped housekeeping do a lot of different things. They, they did kind of some of their own like onboarding checklist. They did go through us ultimately and we, Danny helped build them because this was prior to us launching the checklist in the LMS because they were trying to get, you know, more people on site versus having or as Westgate instead of having contract labor. So hopefully once we can launch all of those checklists for them, it will also be very beneficial up there because I know they were struggling with that. I can confirm the ones that are launched, they are switched over to those now. So Richard or I out there, if you see anybody using a checklist, I might be running it under Danny's nose. Feel free to let me know. Okay, yeah, no problem. And Alex, if we can just get some time together, go through the system and between what, what I need to know. So just, you know, send me an invite and we'll go from there and stuff. But, you know. Yeah, and you know, my goal as well would be with my national calls. You know, my. What I like to do is I like to do show and tell, you know, and it's okay, hey, let's invite someone for Mountainee. Let's invite someone this month from Risk. Invite someone from here and you know, give me five, ten minutes here, you know, talk or let the team talk. Hey, what are your hot topics that you guys are seeing? That I've got the experts here that can help you answer those questions, you know, someone from finance, you know, to help people answer those questions and stuff like that too. So. So I'll reach out at some point and, and get you guys on there as well. And it just helps get questions answered and, you know, understand better what's. What's going on out there on the field. Yeah, we'd love that. I think someone on our team is literally always on the front office monthly call. Like, I swear, every, every month. I think it's somebody on Adam's team actually, but they're always on the front office monthly go. I'M like, so anything you need, we're here to help. We appreciate it. Thank you. Yeah. Alex, you had anything else I saw you unmuted. Yeah, I. I'm. I just assigned all of the housekeeping checklists that are active to you, Richard, so you'll see those. One of the things I'm not positive about is you might get annoying emails for a bit. So if you start to continue to get those regarding the checklist, let me know and I'll go ahead and like pull those off and we'll give you like physical copies. But I just don't know how that's going to work if we turn notifications off for that at certain levels or not. But, like, we have annoying emails that come in, say, hey, you haven't done your course. You haven't done your course. Like, and so that way it kind of holds me accountable. And I'm also sending you a meeting for next week, but if it doesn't work, just let me know and I will get you get it moved to a place that works for you. Sounds good. I appreciate it. I thank you guys for your time. Yeah, of course. Thanks. Return.","📅 **Meeting Overview**: The meeting aimed to discuss ongoing training and standardization efforts within the housekeeping department, including checklist implementation, chemical usage standardization, and the management of contract labor training.

Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah. So we're getting there and I think the on the job training checklist for onboarding and whatnot is going to be a huge driver for that. I think you were copied in some of the recent emails. So for house person and runner, I think there were some ADP and like some title things. So we haven't been able to launch those yet. But on 91 we are going to be launching the public area attendant checklist that I was working with Kat and Aspen and Michelle on. So that one we decided we don't want to hold off any longer. Like we'll, we'll go ahead and launch that one, but once the ADP stuff gets situated and the job title stuff gets situated, we'll be able to launch the other one. So I think I reached out to Lisa, I believe Steph did, and I think the last update we got is that it hasn't been changed yet or updated yet. So once you guys know, let us know and we can launch those other checklists. Okay. If you can forward the public area one to me. I have not seen that one, but I have seen the other one and voice, voice some of my, my suggestions on some of those. So they were working on making something else change. Just happens that every time that call happens with them, I'm either at the villas that were at the lakes, which is great. I'm like, okay, hey, great. Yeah, yeah. I don't plan, it just happens. And I'm like, okay, yeah, definitely, yeah, yeah. So, and, and then any other ones that are being worked on, you know, just please, you know, loop me in so that way I can, I can make sure, you know, we're, we're just consistent. And that's the big thing is being consistent across the board. Absolutely. Yeah. The last thing I just thought of, I know chemicals has been a thing that we're kind of waiting on. So Steve has a really cool micro learning template where he was showing each of the chemicals. So I think the last update I got on that, I think it was something over in the hate saying this procurement, procurement side where they, they really wanted to have the same housekeeping chemicals at all of the properties. And so I think Pat had mentioned most of them could. I might be misspeaking here, but I think Vegas might have been the one or some of the, like the properties out west where they were like, we're not sure if we can get that same chemical out there to use in their housekeeping. So we're ready to try to Jump into that. But I think the last thing we just need is to know the final set of chemicals. And I know that that was something they were working on, so. So if you hear any updates, be sure to let us know. And I know procurement is working on that, and it should be a brand standard across the company. So there shouldn't be. On the west coast with getting. Ain't there as many hotels over there use the same, you know, products and stuff, you know, And I know that, like, some of the big companies Equal Lab, they provide a lot of these training videos too, you know, honor. Okay. So, you know, that's something that, if that's who we go with, it's partnering with them to say, hey, you know, instead of recreating the wheel, let us borrow your train. You know, we can implement them into our stuff. And I know they do a lot of that. They'll do a lot of that on site training as well, for us to make sure everybody's using those chemicals appropriately. They know the SDs behind them, they know the functions and all that as well. So once. Once that gets finalized and I know the work on final details of all that, we can. We can roll those out and get that done. Okay. Yeah, that's great. And if, you know, if you're familiar that they have any videos or anything already, that. That would save us a lot of time. Right? Yeah. So definitely. Definitely let us know about that. Yeah, no, definitely. Definitely. Thank you. Awesome. Well, that's all for me. I guess we'll pass it over to Alex. Yeah. Alex, are you good? I know that you might have to step away for a second. No, I should be okay to go ahead and talk a little about it. So. So nice to meet you, Richard. I know we talked a little bit on the call just a second ago. Well, indirectly. Right. About some of the influence we try to have on the operations. So I handle the training delivery side. So what that means is once Adam's team is done creating it, my team will then take over and deliver it. So that's on general topics that we create or things that are prescribed, things like that. But ultimately, we also oversee the CFT program. And the CFT program is probably our biggest chance to influence the area. And I will say transparently, right off the bat, we haven't always had the best partner in your position in this area. So hearing the standardization, wanting to do everything the same, like, you are screaming our language. So really looking forward to kind of partnering with you on these. We're not doing bad in housekeeping. But I think we can get more cfts, and my team will be driving that right to, you know, and also working with you closely on that, on how we do that and what's going to be this kind of standard. We have a pretty set standard, but ultimately working with you on, like, what kind of people are you looking for? Like, did you hear of anybody great in the property that we could reach out to? Right. Like, things like that. And also vice versa, we'll share with you, like, hey, this person's really strong. You know, we do want to see them as a cft. Their leader did come forward. But. And so ultimately, once that happens, we then can ensure that that standardized training is put across the board. And the cfts are now trained on checklists. That's relatively new. Right. As you came in, as Adam was saying. And so that helps us, like, ensure, to your point, like, they were trained on this date, on this task, and we know that they were told the correct thing. Right. Because you mentioned, I heard you mention earlier, like, oh, we know you were trained the right way, but now you're doing it in your own way. And, and that probably is happening a lot of the same way. But I don't know that I could confidently answer until these checklists came in, like, hey, were they training the right way? So, you know, we're pushing up our influence, and you heard me on the GM call, like, we're making them, making more use of that. That time they were very underutilized, you know, coming in, and we could have done more and more. So I've been back home just over a year, and now we're really pushing, like, to get the most out of them to be the best partner for you and the GMs, and just making sure. Right. And it kind of benefits all of us. So I'm really excited. You know, we had great partners in the past, but not always the best partner on the CFT aspect of it. So really looking forward to that. And it's. And, you know, and, and, and it's that of, you know, that consistency and holding those CFTs, you know, accountable, making sure that, you know, the 30, 60, 90, you know, is accomplished. Okay, where are you at 30 days after your training? Where you at 60 days after your training? Where are you at 90 days, you know, after training? And, you know, to me, big vision would be, you know, we use a heck of a lot of contract labor out there, you know, and a good portion of it is consistent people that come, you know, and, and there's a small portion of it that it's, you know, it's, it's, you know, you're swapping out today for tomorrow and things like that. But, you know, are they following our standards? Are they following our expectations? Are they following, you know, our needs and you know, what we're expecting of them training wise as well? I know, you know, some people say it's a lot of training dollars, it's a lot of time invested to, to get them up in training because they don't stay for long periods of time. But the expectation needs to be there for them as well. You know, an expectation needs to be there that they're accomplishing and doing their job as well. But you know, CFT's out there are, are key for you. You know, they're, they're, they're your trainers. They're the ones that are going to teach, coach, develop your, your, your, your next leaders, you know, and your next people that are going to be successful. So, so excited about that, you know, excited about, you know, what you were talking about in the GM call with, you know, with, with what Omar created and stuff and excited to see that go and, and move and, and add in housekeeping to it because that would be great, great tracking as well for it. And I covered front description on that call. But we do have a housekeeping one that we're starting to roll out and kind of test. So you know, I can try to give with Omar to get a copy of that over to you and just make sure it kind of, we generally make it along with the checklist that we've created. So if there are any changes to that, we can get ahead of that and just kind of make sure that we're observing for the right things and you know, if you identify something over this last quarter that, you know, hey, I'm noticing they're, they're spraying too close to the surface and it's bouncing back, you know, too much. Right. We can add that to the observation and say, okay, you know, over the next quarter we'll specifically look for that behavior. So that'll be really exciting too. Okay. Okay. Yeah. And I know, you know, I know one of the big topics I had earlier today was bedbugs, you know, and it's, it's, it's one of those you hate talking about, but you got to talk about it and you know, what's the training out there for it and yeah, we train you when you get hired in, but you know, you're a 20 year employee. Are you still understanding and understanding how, how Vital, that is to a company. And you know, to me that should be a quarterly or six month training. You know, that it's like a sexual harassment, like a, you know, you know, those kind of trains that you do it every year to remember what you're doing and making sure we're hitting those, you know, those expectations and you know, bed bugs can take you down, man. They can take a whole property down if, if you're not careful. Oh, for sure. It'll impact, impact the brand pretty heavily of that property. Yeah, sure, I know. The reason I'm glad we were going to capture that point is I know you had that pest control person on the thread that we were talking about earlier, but I was hoping to get ahead of it because we do have an E learning and that's probably better in kind of Adam's area because I don't know where it's at from a review perspective, but there is an E learning related to that aspect. So I just want to make sure we got on the conversation about that and if we needed to give you a preview of it and kind of see what maybe plans we could work on with Adam's team. Yeah, no problem. I'd love to see that and love to see, you know, what that's all about. Because like I said, it's, it's, it's key that we're doing it. And you know, like I asked the question on the call I had earlier today, is it more contract labor? Is it more our staff? And it sounds like it's more contract labor. Well, let's, let's, let's hold these guys accountable, make sure they're following, they should be following our same expectations. You know, we spent a lot of money on these guys. And Richard, I guess I would ask about contract labor because this is. In the seven years I've been here, this has gone back and forth many of times. But my understanding of contract labor is that it is not our responsibility to train contract labor. It is contract labor's team's responsibility to train their own teams on our standards. And, and, and, and that is correct. Okay, but are they doing that and are they training them? You know, and, and, and who's, who's doing the checks and balances on them? Right. You know, to say they are training and they are training them correctly or they just brought 10 people off the street that. You know what I'm saying? Yep. Yeah, I get where you're coming from. And it's who's, who's doing the checks and balances for Them. Okay. You know? Okay. Do we have them sign off and say, yeah, they've been Westgate trained and they know the Westgate standards and expectations, and if they come in, they screw something up, then it's. It's. It's on them, you know. And. And things like that. Because it's more and more going out there, talking to resorts. That's where the issues are coming from. Okay. You know, and this time of year when we're so slow, we should have less contract labor, more of our employees, and give them the hours and let them work. All right. If I did this correctly, I think I just assigned you the bedbug course in the lms. If I did it correctly, it's usually something Alex would probably do or Adam, but I think I did it right. I'm sure you did. Yeah. If you don't see it, Richard, just let me know and I can take a look. I'm trying to think of other housekeeping items we have. Are you able to do the floor cleaning as well? Stuff. I think that's another one. Is it? Or are those does who does the floor cleaning for some. I can look that up for some reason. I didn't know. I don't know that that was specific to. I see floor safety. Floor safety. That's the one. Floor safety. How tos. Okay. Yeah, that one. I don't know. I'm trying to look that one up and see. I don't know who that's assigned to. I don't know how to tell. Alex, do you know how to. I. I'm not good on this side of the lms. I'm looking. Yeah, I'm looking into that now. You said floor safety. Okay. So. Yeah, Richard, that. That bedbug one is already in the lms. I don't know what the cadence is. Alex would be able to look and see, like, what the cadence is as far as. Is if. Is it assigned on higher, and then is it reassigned at any point? I do not believe it's reassigned at any point at this time. And that course has been around for a while, so if there is, you know, an opportunity for us to improve it. Adam, could we find the Scorm file? Yeah, we could. I could see if we have the file still. Let me verify that. Okay. If we have the Scorm file still, we could put it in a review link for you, Richard, and we could send it to you. We could even send it to, like, Pat, Michelle, Aspen, and you guys could all put comments in the review and, like, give specific feedback on slides specifically that you would want to see change. But yeah, that's definitely something that we would have to kind of look into a little bit further and give you see if we have that SCORM file. Some of these were created by old instructional designers and we don't have those files. So it's pulling up for me now. So I got it. I'm looking at it. Okay. To begin the course. Perfect. Yep. I'll look through it and. And go through there. Yeah, I just, I, you know, to me, that's. That, that's a hot topic. Okay. You know. Okay. And that's one that just needs to be reinforced. The procedure as well. I know going through procurement, it's. It's funny because they, they look at the usage on it, you know, and the usage on the chemical. And the usage on the chemical is very low right now, you know, so my question is, are you really using what you're supposed to be using to do the job? You know, and that's where, you know, that's where my mind goes and says, yeah, you know, it's an extra chemical for you and you just don't want to carry it. So. Okay, makes sense. Yeah. Well, we'll see if we'll find the review360 link, because if you want to be able to give feedback, that's going to be easier. I know you have access in the LMS now, but. And then, Alex, let's also find out how often that course is assigned. Is there any Richard data currently on any type of bedbug reports that we have? Like, are we seeing an increase or a spike over the last like 30, 60, 90 days of any type of increase? Or are you looking at the data from the perspective of. I just don't see the chemical being used as much, so I just want to know. So that way, if we. When we move in this direction. Right. And we say right now it's only assigned once a year, but we're going to move into this direction of it being signed quarterly or however it is you want to assign. Looks like the course says it's 25 minutes right now, I imagine. Adam, I don't know if you know, but it's probably a rough estimate, so we probably would need to figure out the right estimate on what that is. But I want to be able to see that if we are assigning it that much and we're spending that much time to take the course, are we reducing the number of bedbug incidents being reported or are we using the chemical more Right So like what are those data points that you're looking at? And I know the. So the reason all this started was there was a spike and the calls and the spike for the number of calls was, was Lakes, Myrtle Beach, Cocoa beach, you know, in Vegas were the top ones that the spike was in. So then my question was, you know, okay, we use a chemical for what's the chemical usage? And then the report came out and the usage was very low. And I was like, okay, well then that's a concern to me because if it is low, you know, and, and, and we're spiking. Yeah, great. It's slow right now. But you know, and then my question was, what are we doing training wise? You know, is this, you know, of course that we do all time. What's the SOP on it? You know, so I got the SOP today on it. I've got the training. So you know, it's something that we need to keep on radar and keep on radar all the time. Okay. It's also something. And Alex, to see your hands up. But like you say you have a spike in these four properties right now, like we could even read. Alex, you're going to have to correct me on this if there's something not right here. But I do think we can push out just to those four properties for them to retake the course. And then you could also. You should. And I don't know if you KP set this up for you yet, but you should have access to review reporting for the entire housekeeping department across the organization. So, so. That was going to be. My next question was do I have access to bill view that they are completing the training and where they at? Because that is something that I want to be able to talk about on my national call as well. You know that I do and say, hey, you know, our usage is low. You guys are saying everybody's completing the training, but you know, my numbers don't match up, you know, or the train low and the usage is low. Well, that makes sense. Why you, you know, you're spiking. Yeah, things like that. Of course. Yeah. Alex, do you have something? Yeah, I got, I got five to run through there. I captured five. So yes, we will set up your view as there's a national director view where you'll be able to see everybody across the entire company probably except Vegas in like in housekeeping. But obviously that can be fixed. Big Vegas though. Big Vegas. Yeah, the casino. And so that if that hasn't been set up, then she'll probably set that up in there near future and we can follow up on that. Number two, yes. We can push the training out to certain properties, even certain departments, even certain jobs. So we can go all the way down if we need to. We could target a housekeeper job at Flamingo Bay in Vegas if we need to. So yeah, we could do that. Number three, actually, I'll combine the last few bed bugs. Floor safety are both assigned to housekeeping and they are one time assignments, so. So they don't recur. That I can see. But KP will be the ultimate expert on that. But then I can see it doesn't recur, but we can always update that. I don't know the complexities of that, but that's more of a KP1. But we can investigate that if that's where the direction we want to go. Yeah, yeah, I'd like to go that way. And I'd start right now. Probably do it once every six months, so twice a year, you know, deploy it out and then I guess. And I probably know the answer to this question, but I guess my next question will be, you know, the big topic, you know, how do we track what contract labor is doing, you know, on this? Do. I know it's their job to make sure the training's done, but is there a way of tracking that they're getting this training as well. So contract labor would not end up in our LMS because they're not in adp. So everything's automated is to the degree we can automate it on our side. Right. And so I'm sure there's some type of way. I just think we might have to get creative. Alex, I saw you unmute. Were you going to say the same thing or did you have something else? Yeah, word for word what you're going to say. Except for the last part because the last part is extremely manually intensive. But we can't. There are workarounds that can be done upending whatever contracts, things happen. But I think Steph mentioned that a little earlier. That's where our peers have always come in. But. But there's always a way. I will say that. Well, I was gonna say, depending on what it is. Alex and Adam, we can also. We can offline about this. Maybe there's a way you could be creative that's not in the lms because I know the LMS is very labor intensive, but I imagine they're using hot sauce devices, right, Richard? Yes, yes. So they're using hot sauce devices. They're getting hot sauce logins. Yeah. Hot sauce has checklist. So maybe there's, I don't know, just thinking outside the box, like, is there a way. I mean, this has always been. This has been a reoccurring, ongoing issue. Right. Last. The whole time I've been at Westgate. So, yeah, I don't know if there's a way to, you know, you share this video and put them in a room, have them watch the video and then they sign off and that checklist gets, you know, upload. So I, you know, I, I don't know. I'm, you know, old school. It's the way we used to do it is, hey, put them all together. You know, someone logs into their, you know, training, shows them video, and then everybody signs off that they watched it. You know, it's a way to kind of knock them all out in a quick aspect. But you guys are the experts on that, not me. Is there any. Anything in the contract with our. With that them that says there's certain things we can and can't do when it comes to that? I don't know. Okay. I don't know. Honestly, I haven't, I haven't dived into the contract check. Okay. So that. Lisa, at least a question I need to ask. It's always been some, some of my understanding is that while they should be doing it, it's like that we don't want to take the liability of doing it to some degree. Right. I think is where all that's come from. Like, I've been through a projects with different things and, and I recall also the name tag issue. Right. Like, we didn't want them wearing a name tag that had a Westgate logo because ultimately then we take liability for them if something happens. So there was like a lot of liability things that came out of the whole training, which is why we've kind of steered as clear as possible from it. But if you can find out any of that information and just give it back to us, I think the team can find ways that we could be creative. And then in the data points that you're pulling, is the increase that you're seeing from those four properties, is there a way for those calls for us to be able to decipher if contract labor or Westgate was in the room? It was contract labor. Okay. I asked that question. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah. And that was my question was on those spikes and those housekeepers, was it. Was it our team or was it a contract labor? And they said they were all contract labor. Okay. Which. That's where my you know, and, and I understand where you come from, you know, legally and, and things, but that's where my concern comes in. And my next question was, okay, if I'm compensating a guest, if, if I've got pest control coming out and now we're losing revenue on this room, you. Know, are we charging back contract labor? Yeah, yeah. Are we charging them back? Because this is, you know, it. That is a way for me to say, hey, you need to be on the, on your game, you know, about what we're doing, you know, and, and, and our expectation stuff. And, you know, part of the answer was yes, part of the answer was no. And some properties are doing it, some aren't. And I'm like, okay, we're, you know, you get hit on one end, but you're not getting hit on the other. So, you know, that's, that's, that, that's a question I need to find out as well get an answer for. Because, you know, truthfully, you know, if you own a contract labor company, apdc, and I'm going hand you a hundred times, you know, for this at an expense, you know, a thousand bucks a time or more, you know, you're going to feel it at some point. Yes. Do we know, are those rooms inspected? Are. Do they. Do they self inspect their own rooms? Or are they also. Do they self inspect. Are they inspected by APDC or are they inspected by us? As far as I understand, they're inspected by apdc, by whatever contract labor company it is. Okay. Yeah. And that might be the next level is then, you know, we need to start inspecting the contract labor and, you know, and, and things like that. You know, one of the questions came up this on my call today was, you know, is there another level of inspection that our housekeepers can do? Like, you know, instead of lifting the mattress, you gotta slide it anyways, you know, to, to tuck the sheet in, you know, can you, in that training put in there, say, okay, make sure you slide the sheet out and check, you know, behind it for, you know, for those bedbugs, you know, not have to lift it because they are heavy and we don't want you to, you know, to hurt yourself and, you know, in that, that liability. But, you know, that's. I, that question was what I asked, and that's. That's where my concern comes up. Okay. Yeah. I think if you could get us some more information, I saw both Adam and Alex on me too, but if you could just get us some more information on the contract, I think we could toss around some ideas and then. Adam, did you have something? Yeah, I was just gonna ask Alex, is there a way? I don't really know how to do it. I mean, I'm sure I could figure it out, but I just don't want to break anything. Can we assign the housekeeping checklist to Richard? They are in production. I just want to have him see, like, what from a front end use end user would see. Yeah, and they're all ready to go, like, public areas in there. But the other ones, I think we're just waiting on, like, the title clarification in adp. But I just want to give you an opportunity to be able to see, like, what the team member will see. Yeah, I can take care of that right now. Okay. And then I did confirm with kp. Richard, you do have access to all housekeeping. Now, the expert that would have to show you how to look at all that is Alex Moats, because I don't know how to look at all of that, but. What was that again? I missed that. I said he does have. He does have National Director access to all of housekeeping, but you would be the expert in showing him how to, like, look at some of those dashboards, like, look at compliance, like, see. See how many people have completed checklists. And so ultimately, Richard, once we launch, fully launch the checklist for on the job training, you would be able to go in there and see, like, have these new hires completed it, have their CFTs checked off on it and all of that. So you're going to be able to kind of oversee housekeeping in all of those different things. So perfect. And, you know, my, my ultimate goal on that would be, you know, I come from Master Corp, okay, Master Corp. Part of our QA inspection is we inspect. We. You get inspected on that as well. So you come in and they pull up your training, okay, is everybody complete or all your checklists done or are you, you know, and if they're not, you get marked off and you get graded on that, you know, and that's how I held my teams accountable for making sure training was done, making sure that their checklist. And then you hire paperwork was done and, and you know, we weren't missing anything. It was part of your qa, right? QA came in and they audited you and you didn't pass it. Why? This is the most important thing out there, you know, training. I love that. Sounds like Peter's inspect what you expect, right? Is that what he says? Inspect what you expect? Yeah, yeah, Yep, yep. And I talked to Field about it, and Field's on board with it, you know, and stuff. So I told him, I said, let me just understand more of the process. And then we can, you know, we can look at it and possibly add it in there. And it's, you know, you hold people accountable for what they're doing, and that's the best way to do it. And then we can all go back and look and say, okay, you know, so and so has been in 100 or so and so is, you know, here. And why aren't we doing the training? I. I'd love to toss an ignorant question out there. I always talk to Faith. I mean, not Faith. I was looking at Faith's message to me. Pat. I always. I was talking to Pat a couple weeks ago about kind of the contractors and stuff. And it. I couldn't tell. She. I wasn't sure for sure if I'm remembering this inaccurately, but I thought we billed them by the rooms that we asked them to clean, or is it by the number of hours we bill out? Like, do we bill the number of hours that we needed that day by person, or do we bill out the number of rooms? So they get paid piece rate. So they get. Build by the number of rooms. Hold on. Bill in them. Yeah. Billing them is by the hour. They get paid by the room that they clean. So the company pays them by the room, but we bill them by that. Okay, gotcha. That was. I remember Impact. That must be why I remembered it confusingly, because that she explained probably the exact same thing. And so I was like, well, how can we not just inspect the room and if it doesn't pass, they don't get paid. But. But I was like. And she was like, you don't understand. I was like, okay, all right, I got you. When Pat tells me I don't understand, I just back out. That's the. That's the rule run here. I think it's different in Smokey though, right? I think Smokey. We do pay them by the room. Yeah. Like, we actually pay the contract company by the room. That. Because it's cabin. I don't know. It's very. Smokey's also like that super weird one. Yeah. They're like 70 plus. There are a lot of contracts. I don't understand how we can't convert them to team members. I'll be out there next week. So I got a lot, a lot, a lot I'm looking at out there. So. Okay, well, anything you hear or any feedback you have from Us or any help or support you need from us, please reach out, please let us know. Adam and Alex, they're. They're the experts in the sides of the business that they run for learning. So, you know, feel free. Alex's team is all out on the site, so you'll have trainers out there that are not CFTs but training specialists that are on his team. So when you go to Smokey, you might meet Danny. So Danny's a training specialist out there and I know she's helped housekeeping do a lot of different things. They, they did kind of some of their own like onboarding checklist. They did go through us ultimately and we, Danny helped build them because this was prior to us launching the checklist in the LMS because they were trying to get, you know, more people on site versus having or as Westgate instead of having contract labor. So hopefully once we can launch all of those checklists for them, it will also be very beneficial up there because I know they were struggling with that. I can confirm the ones that are launched, they are switched over to those now. So Richard or I out there, if you see anybody using a checklist, I might be running it under Danny's nose. Feel free to let me know. Okay, yeah, no problem. And Alex, if we can just get some time together, go through the system and between what, what I need to know. So just, you know, send me an invite and we'll go from there and stuff. But, you know. Yeah, and you know, my goal as well would be with my national calls. You know, my. What I like to do is I like to do show and tell, you know, and it's okay, hey, let's invite someone for Mountainee. Let's invite someone this month from Risk. Invite someone from here and you know, give me five, ten minutes here, you know, talk or let the team talk. Hey, what are your hot topics that you guys are seeing? That I've got the experts here that can help you answer those questions, you know, someone from finance, you know, to help people answer those questions and stuff like that too. So. So I'll reach out at some point and, and get you guys on there as well. And it just helps get questions answered and, you know, understand better what's. What's going on out there on the field. Yeah, we'd love that. I think someone on our team is literally always on the front office monthly call. Like, I swear, every, every month. I think it's somebody on Adam's team actually, but they're always on the front office monthly go. I'M like, so anything you need, we're here to help. We appreciate it. Thank you. Yeah. Alex, you had anything else I saw you unmuted. Yeah, I. I'm. I just assigned all of the housekeeping checklists that are active to you, Richard, so you'll see those. One of the things I'm not positive about is you might get annoying emails for a bit. So if you start to continue to get those regarding the checklist, let me know and I'll go ahead and like pull those off and we'll give you like physical copies. But I just don't know how that's going to work if we turn notifications off for that at certain levels or not. But, like, we have annoying emails that come in, say, hey, you haven't done your course. You haven't done your course. Like, and so that way it kind of holds me accountable. And I'm also sending you a meeting for next week, but if it doesn't work, just let me know and I will get you get it moved to a place that works for you. Sounds good. I appreciate it. I thank you guys for your time. Yeah, of course. Thanks.

I used to be the chief operating officer, but I'm retiring in December, so I've kind of taken a seat back and doing a semi retirement until then. Okay. So, you know, I still have the responsibility, but only part of the pay because I'm only working part time. Okay, got it. So if you're wondering where I fit in that equation, that's where it is. I. Okay. I've done this alliance for I don't know how many years. I was hoping last year was the last year, but evidently not. I guess the only way I can get out of it is to completely leave. It's to get out of it. Yes. So I'm just. We're not doing, we're not doing a keynote speaker this year because I think there's a lot of stuff going on, on between the two companies. Okay. Of course our employees have a lot of questions and, you know, between now and the first of the year, there's going to be a lot of, well, a lot. There's going to be some significant changes. And so I know one of the things I want to put up. I. Want to put a positive spin on, you know, some of the things that are happening. Okay. And I'm hoping that you can do that for us. Of course, yes. So do you have any ideas about. Well, I know one of the things. You know what, let me, I, I asked, I asked the managers for questions. Okay. Okay. And let me just look at that right now and that might give you some ideas. Okay. Hello, how are you? A lot of questions. We're surrounded with benefits and things, but there were some other things. Okay. Well, one of the questions that might fall in your category. How do you recognize resorts and. Resorts and resort staff throughout the company? Okay. What does Westgate have to motivate on site resort staff? What are some of the offerings that Westgate uses to be competitive in attracting staff in resort areas? What can we expect in regards to on site training for our resort staff from Westgate? Okay. Just those kind of, you know, just those kind of general questions. Do you, do you mind to share the list with me of those questions or just, again, if there's some that you don't want to. Perfectly fine. But I also can, can meet with my other, like, peers in, in the broader, like, people and culture division. And if there's any questions that maybe I, I heard you say something about benefits. Right. While it doesn't align under me, it aligns more under Shea. That is something that I can get with Shea prior to and maybe have a couple touch points that I can talk about with that because she would be able to provide that information. Okay, I'll go through. And I mean it live. I just need to eliminate some of them that, you know, specifically benefit related and. And you don't want that. You don't want those, right? I mean, if you want to give them to me and I can ask Shay just like, hey, do you have an answer for this already? I think if she has an answer, I can answer and then defer anything else. Like let's say I'm answering the question and. And then another question sparks from that. I would say I'm going to take a note of that and I will get back to you once I return. Right. Because if they, if they ask me something, I'm not one, then I can always just notate those down and bring them back later. But yeah, if you want to send me all of them. I've just done a copy and paste as they sent the email. So I just need to format. I'll get it to you by the first of the week. Does that work? Yeah, that works perfectly. Yeah. Okay. Most of them that are going to do questions probably have. There may be. There may be some others that come in and I could actually send those to you later. Okay. Yeah, that's fine. Okay. And in terms of just. I know you had. I. I wasn't, I wasn't in the office when he came. Alex, is it Jason. Alex. Alex, yes. Okay. So now most of those manage all of the managers. When Alex came to the Bellevue office, there's. There was no resort managers there. So. Okay. There are some corporate people that are going to be attending, but really they are attending as a support to the managers. This really is about bringing the resort managers together. Okay. Okay. I mean, that's what. So anything that Alex said, and I understand that was kind of crazy then, but. But I think there's, you know, the information that will come out is a lot, a lot more clear now. But anything that Alex said at that. And in Bellevue when he came, these two Zark managers didn't even hear it. Okay. Okay. Yeah, I'll go back and take a look at that. I think there was some really nice videos too that he had been able to show. So. Yeah, I'll go back and grab that from him and then see what I can do. Yeah. And you know, keep in mind that these resort managers don't work on the same level that yours do for the most part. I mean, our biggest Resort is like 136 units in Mexico. Okay. US is. US is 116. So. Okay. And some of them are in so remote areas that everybody that works at the property is related, which is, you know, it's a huge problem for them, you know, because it's that I've hired my cousin and now I want to fire him, and I can't fire him because he's my cousin. Yeah. But there's nobody else to hire. Everybody is related, you know? Yep. I understand. We have some. We have that in some places, too. Like in Tennessee, where it's just like, you know, kind of remote. Yep. I mean, we do have. Our employee handbook says no hiring. I mean, we've even got a situation where the wife is the manager and the husband is the maintenance man. It's just remote. Yeah. I just don't want to know when there's marital conflict. Right. And, you know, it always comes with problems, but sometimes there's just. No, there's. There's just no other way to work around it. Of course. That makes sense. So anything that you can share in terms of just leadership training that there is available, if you have anything available, I think they'll be interested in that. Okay. And again, I wasn't there when Alex was there, so I don't. I don't even know what he. What he said. Okay. Or what he had. Okay. So is the. Is the thought to do, like. Do you want me to just kind of talk about what leadership training we have available and maybe what we are going to be able to offer them in the future? Or. Or do you also want me to do some type of session around some type of leadership training? Can you do both? I can do both, Yes. I can do both. Okay. How much time is, like, allotted? You know what I have. You're really lucky because I haven't got the agenda completely finished yet. Okay. How much time would you want. Is there a specific. Is there for. For the Q and A stuff? I think it's going to be dependent upon the questions. Right. Like, once you send me the questions, let me look through them and see what they are and how in depth we go on some of those. And then for leadership training, is there one. You know, is there a specific topic that you would like me to focus on? Is there. And I can also. We are about to roll out 12 leadership competencies for Westgate. Now, we've done this once since my time here, where we've adopted these. A couple years ago, we actually built their. Built them at our GM session, which was kind of cool. Because they were shaped a little bit by them and we did a very soft launch of them. And we've never really done a full company rollout. And so part of 2026 is plan will be to do a full company roll out of these 12, like, leadership competencies. And we'll actually hold our, like, all the leaders would be held accountable to meeting the behaviors within those competencies. Right. So, you know, I could always do something around that. I don't know if that's too in depth already or if there's like one topic that you're like, let's focus on this leadership skill. We can do something like that. I mean, I have a ton of different things in my, like, in my, like, you know, box that I could go pull out, just depending on what you want. Well, you know, I think really your. One of the things that they like to do the most and it seems like we never have enough time is we call it our best practices session. Okay. And they really, like, they really like to start talking about. About that kind of stuff. You are really, you will be the only one where there is a really, what I could call a work session. Okay. Okay. So I would be totally okay with you rolling that out in a soft form, you know? Okay. I love it. I love it. I would say I love. I love work sessions because I will tell you, I'm the kind of person that's like, if you want to sit in your seat, you came to the wrong room because we are not sitting in our seat. Like, we're getting up. We're going to do something. Okay. So if you can work it around that, I would love that. Okay. The other thing is I sent a question out. You know, I. One thing I like to do is just give random awards for different things. Right. Okay. And so I sent a question out to the managers yesterday about what's been your biggest challenge. What's been your biggest challenge for the last year? Okay. This past year, interestingly enough, one of them came back with, I spend the majority of my time mediating between the staff. Meaning she's got a lot of drama going on. Yes. I mean, I've gotten. I got a little bit more than I asked for when I asked that question. But, you know, really, that's okay. Because some of that we can talk about in best practices. It's not a big deal. But that one was especially geared to. Okay. How could. How can we help with that? Okay. Okay. I mean, of course there's always, well, I can't find employees and Da. Da Da, da, da. Yeah, I know, I know. We've been hearing that for three years. Right, Right. But this one was. Especially when I send you the other stuff. I will. I will send the specific. I will send what she specifically said. Okay. But basically, that's what it was. I spent. I'm spending all my time just mediating between the staff, helping them get along better. Okay. Okay. So maybe if you could do something a little bit around that, that would be helpful too. Okay. Yeah, I think that's something I can. You know, honestly. You got. At the resort, you've got mostly females. I mean, let's take it. Yeah, we do. We have mostly females. And there sometimes gets to be a lot of drama going on. Oh, I know. Our front office. We. We hire so many female leadership in all of our front office across the company. And I'm like. They're constantly, like, you know, bickering back and forth, and I'm like, what is happening? Like, but they make these really great leaders and they do really well in the front office. But then we. Ye. So. No, I completely understand that. Okay. I think I can come up with some stuff. I think once you send me everything, I can kind of start to look at it and shape, you know, But I would love to do some type of working session where I get them up out of their seats doing something, so. Absolutely. I love that. I think. Because probably you're the only one. You're. Because I don't have a keynote speaker, you're probably the only one that will do anything like that. Okay. Okay. And then what. Do you have a day in time slot already that you're thinking or. Because I am coming in. Did you see one or. I don't. Okay. I. I think it would be best to do you in the morning so they're fresh and tired. Okay. You know, because for a manager to sit all day and be. It's pretty tough because most of them are out and about and moving around. Right, Exactly. They find this especially challenging. Do you have a preference on. On the day? I don't. I do. I am. I. I don't know exactly what all the agenda is, but I'm coming in on Sunday, so I get in on Sunday at, like, noon. Yeah. So Sunday we just. We're doing some beach games together. We're doing a beach dinner. Okay. I'm putting together an email out, an email that will go out sometime next week with more explanations. Okay. And. And I'll make sure that. So you, Garrett and Peter are all. Are all coming. So I'll make sure that I get you guys the memo too. Some of it won't pertain to you, but that's fine. You skip over that part. Okay. Okay. Yeah. And so we'll be in meetings all day, all day Monday and Tuesday. Okay. We quit. We do quit fairly early because, you know, we try to do. Monday evening, we're going to do a city tour. And you know, we try to mix the fun stuff up with. So it isn't all just boring. Okay. So, yeah, either day's fine with me. Whatever works for the schedule. Okay. I'll probably do Tuesday morning. Okay. Probably. Okay. But again, I've got to get that finalized and I'll let you know what the agenda is. Specifically what the agenda is. Okay. I would say at least 90 minutes. You know, that's exactly what I. Yeah, okay. Perfect. Okay. Yeah. So if you can just send me. Over, send me the questions. I'm going to send you that one specific comment that the, the one manager had said about mediating. Okay. Sounds good. And yeah, thank you for your patience with this meeting. I, I, that's the first time I've ever had and I've done other. I don't typically use meetings, but I mean, I've certainly, certainly used them, you know, when from invites. Right. And I've never had that kind of a problem. I know. I was like, that's even think to. Look in the chat in the junk box. I know. I was like, that's weird. It's on my calendar and her name is on it. So like, so I just like added you again. Doing, doing an alliance was doing it in Hawaii and the vendor, it was the hotel where we were gonna have our meetings at. I could not get an email from them. Every. I couldn't get it. It would go to my. It. I wouldn't even, no, I wouldn't even get it, period. So finally I ended up having to just use my personal email, which I never check because I don't have time to check my personal. And so that was really, really, that was a challenge. And I even checked my personal email just because. Okay. Could it have routed over there somehow? But anyway, thank you for your patience. Yeah, no, I'm looking forward to meeting you in person and I think it'll be great. Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. And once you send me all that and I work up some stuff, I will also share kind of just my thoughts in, in session and we can even connect again and kind of run through what I'm thinking I'm gonna do. That way you kind of know, and you can say, yes. No. Like, no, that's not going to land well with them. Like, you know, of course, I. I'm. I've been running the GM conferences here for the past seven years, so I know what these GMs want. Right. And. But I just want to make sure I give you guys exactly, you know, what is going to land well with them and what works for them. So. Okay. Okay. Perfect. Okay, sounds good. All right, thank you. Thanks.

All right. So you have concerns about this one? Yeah. So I did speak with Stacy. We need to remove all of them at the. At the Village Resort Services because of the union. We can't touch those. Okay. There's a separate note out here for that. Or what do you want to do? I would just delete them completely or hide them to avoid someone. If we just delete that, how are we communicating that to Peter? Like. Oh, we'll just let Peter know because of the union. We're not. We. We cannot. I just say we remove the resource services at the villas because they're union. That's it. Yeah. Or hide it. I mean. And you're not going to answer these questions? Oh, that. I am not sure. Well, I'm assuming it's because they're. Because of the union. Right? Well, the Lakes is not union. Yeah. So, I mean, there are questions on here. I feel like. Yeah, we could definitely answer those questions. I mean, the, The Villas were not touched because they're union. So we need to. We need to eliminate those resource services. The Lakes. I am not sure. And I. I don't know how to say. I don't know. I wasn't. I wasn't involved in. I cannot type today. Unsure. We'll need to check with who is in charge of this project. I don't know. Unsure. Because they are not. Because they are not. Union should have been increased. I bet you they were. Huh? I bet you they were brought up to 16. I bet you the dollar was just not added back. Oh. Which means. Which in theory means they should be at. They should have been at. They should have been at 16 with a dollar. They should have been at 17. They need to be at 1750 now. But resort services needs to remain the same. They're not to be touched for the villas. Reserve services at the villas are not to be touching. I just have a feeling they're gonna mess with it. Wonder if we should just delete it or put it in a different tab. Well, who you think? Who is he sending this to? I have no idea. Listen, it's up to you. I don't know when it comes. I don't like. I don't send a lot of stuff back and forth like this computer. So I wouldn't really know how he wants to see it. I would assume he wants answers to these questions, though. Yeah, which we. Which we answered. It. Do we want to put them in red? I like that, but that's a better idea. This is definitely going to call attention. And then I'll Also put them at the bottom maybe. Okay. Okay. And then as for those two questions for Bell staff, I mean, Bell services, they. The. I mean, they're combined now to build services. Not in every area. I mean, we still have some golf cart. No, they're not. Because that's how he got the position. Golf cart. Unless I wrote that. They should be combined. Oh, yeah, you're right. Bel says I must have wrote golf cart on these. You filled that out or. No, this must have been from the document I sent originally. They must have just copied these. The name, the location, the position, and they put the team member ID number. And you think they would have actually went back and redid this if it was wrong? But that's our HRS Partners. They. Somebody put correct position. Bell Services. Yeah. And he says that they need a cfc. So can you just change Bell star. Can you change golf card to Bell Services? Like in. In the position? Yeah, and it was also a typo. And why. All right, I can. Or I can just say this should have been Bell services. It was a typo on my part. Yeah. So. But all. All in all, we're fine with this. So they're at 606. They move up to 1650, and then with the doll, go up to 1750, 1545. Oh, so we're not really giving them a dollar. I see what he's doing. Okay, so, like, this one was at 1640. New rate, 1650. And then the 3 merit increase brings it to 1689. See, that's the part that confused me, and that's why I thought you and I needed to talk about this. He said, please let me know if you agree with these calculations and we'll submit for the market wage adjustments. Just a reminder, if the market wage adjustment places them over a 3% increase on their base salary, then they would not be Merit eligible in 2020. So this doesn't. These two. It doesn't put over. So these two would be. These two right here. Right. Would be eligible for. If I'm reading this correctly, and I understand correctly, these two would be eligible for a merit increase. Everybody else would not be eligible for a merit increase because this puts them right. Am I reading that correctly or am I not. Wait. Oh, he put yes or no. Yeah, I'm reading. Yeah. These are eligible merit. These are not eligible for merit. Okay. Yeah. And then what we're gonna do if Kathy can't. He was going to talk to John. But if Kathy can't fix it, she should be able to. But if she can't after talking to John every year, when it comes time for merit, and this is going to now be all cops, not just these, will back out the dollar, add the 3% merit to the base rate, find out what that. Then add the dollar back and find out what the percent is. So that way we can make sure we give them the right increase. So they should not be getting 3% on top of the whole pay. They should be getting 3% on top of the base rate. Makes sense. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So my team's gonna have to. If Kathy can't fix it, we'll create a quick reference guide. And during the rollout of all of this, we'll make sure that there's a quick reference guide for everyone to look at when it comes to cfts. So. All right. So we can just. I can save this. Yeah. Can I save this somewhere that nobody can see it? In this in your SharePoint? Yeah. Go to. Maybe go to Front office alignment. No, I'm sorry. No. Go to. Go click on guest services up here. No, not that one. Like up to your right. Yeah. And then click on the guest services in the URL. Yeah. And then look for front office initiative. Okay. Oh, I don't have a rate. I mean, probably create a rate folder or we could just put it on the market analysis. Whichever. And nobody else really has access to see that. To market analysis. I think only Rob and. Okay. Only Rob and Lisa. I think sa. I probably.","📅 **Meeting Overview**: The meeting focused on discussing changes to resort service listings, addressing union restrictions, adjustments to wage calculations, and organizing documents for internal review.

Yes, I got it. Do we need to answer that email? Let me go back to it really quick. That just kind of glanced here last night. Peter and his. Who were they meeting with this morning? Because they were all dressed. None of them had on. Peter's being filmed today, but they were all, like, dressed. I think they're meeting with a vendor for some program that he mentioned yesterday. It's between him, Stacy, Nathaniel, I think his name is. Or Nathan. Is it Nathan or Nathaniel? I think it's Nathaniel's and Branson. Right? Yeah, Nathan. So they're all meeting. There's. He mentioned it yesterday during their meeting that they have that meeting today and he's flying down to be a part of it. Yeah, they. Who they were meeting with on the third floor. Okay. Good evening. When we did the market adjustment calculations to the front desk agencies, it was moved. It was to move the minimum wage from 16 to 1650. Unfortunately, since the dollar differential is calculated in their wages, the CFTs were missed. The attached spreadsheet illustrates the base payment of the CFT differential upon which we based our decision. And then we added the dollar bracket. Please let us know if you agree with these calculations. Oh, yeah, we need to look at this. Please let us know if you agree with these calculations. And we will submit for market wage adjustments for those eligible to be effective on September 5th. Just remember, if the market wage adjustment places them over a 3% increase on their base salary, then they would not be eligible. They would not be merit eligible in 2026. We will not be adjusting for compression. That's a shit. That pisses me off. They didn't adjust for compression last time either. So we do need. There's a sheet that we need to look at and reply. Yeah, he attached the spreadsheet. We need to look at it and apply. I did open this last night. I remember opening it now, but it was too many numbers for me. Okay. So I just was like, I needed to look at it with you. Because basically what they did is anybody who. So market wage eligible. So they took anyone that was. Yeah, they put base pay. No put pay, what their current pay is. They subtracted a dollar because of CFT and gave us their new base pay. So you have about 11 people that are technically under the base pay. So he put their. He gave them their new rate, which is literally just bringing all of them up to 1650. Doesn't make any sense to me. Yeah, this is where it gets confusing to me. Like, so Alberto was at 1640 with the dollar removed. Okay, so they bring him up to 1650. And then there's another column that says 3% merit increase. And then there's a delta of the market versus the merit, which is negative 39 cents. And so their new hourly rate with the CFT differential is 1750. Literally looks like he's just bringing all of them up to 1750, which is a pretty big increase for some of them. Like, I can't say this girl's name in resort services, but she's at 15, so she's technically at 14. L. Huh? Oh, but they can't do resource services though. Resource services is a reunion. Oh, then we're gonna need to tell him. Did you open the sheet or no? No. Well, Lakes Resort Services we could do, right? Yes. So Lakes, you have Janet, who's at 16 right now, which technically means she's at 15 base pay. They're going to bring her up to 1650. That's a $50 increase. Right. And then now she'll be at 1750. And then he's asking why was this not increased when we went to 16? So he's asking about the two at the villas and the one at the Lakes and Resort Services. Why were these not increased when we went to 16? Yeah, why would. Because they're union. They can't get a market increase. Correct. I. I gotta talk to Stacy about it. Yeah, that's what I was told. And I wasn't involved in. In that one. Okay. I had no idea. And then on these Bell services once he said, what role is golf cart? Does this need a CFT on both of those ones of Villas ones at Lakes? Oh, yeah. I mean, Bell services department is as big as front desk. Exactly. So. Yeah, but like people like Ananda, she won't get it. She's already at 2345. Andrea. She's already at 2045. Andrea is. Huh. Andre is the front desk. Jen, front desk at the Villas. Okay. Yeah. Okay. There's like 13 of them that won't get an increase at all. Not right now. Do you wanna. Okay. Do you think it's correct or you still want to review it? I kind of want to go take a quick show and then head on. You think it's correct? Yeah, I think it's correct. I just don't like. Well, no, because you're saying this village, these two Villas, Resort services shouldn't get it because they're union. Yeah. Wait, there's three Villas Resort Services on here. You wanna do it when you just call me back when you're done? Yeah, when I. Once I'm done, I'm gonna just head out. Maybe we could. Do you have a call around, say, 10:30 or 11? I'm free. I have KP from 10 to 10:30 and then I'm free. Okay, so let's set up something for 10:30 then a quick review. I just got another overdue task, by the way. Yeah. Because I. I just fix it. So when I fix it, it restart the server and it's gonna check again. Okay. So it would be like, it's the first task it's sending out now. Like, it's. So we shouldn't get another one. But if it continues, I gotta fix it again. But. Yeah, and I'm doing it in production because it works perfect in development. But I'm just gonna do it in production too, through the live text. If you don't want to get one, you would turn off your. Your notification. Yeah, no, it's fine. I don't mind to get one. I just didn't know if it was still like. Yeah, that's fine. Okay. Okay. I'll talk to you soon. All right. Okay.","📅 **Meeting Overview**:

Or wants to have put together for this, because I don't really know if that's his decision. Might be more of your decision. Yeah, I know he had said he. Didn'T think it was, like, that complicated. So I don't know. Maybe. Let me see if we should wait on him. I don't. See if he answers. Okay. He's not answering. So I guess you want to just go over with me, like, what the change is, and maybe we can kind of go from there. He. He thought. He didn't think it was going to be a lot. Like, he thought it was going to. Be pretty easy, but, yeah, it should be pretty easy. So I guess it's just a matter of, like, what you guys decide you want to do, but. So in the billing screen of the reservation under the holds tab is where we made the changes. So this container has been created. It didn't used to be a container. Let me go find one that'd probably be a little bit better. Okay. So it didn't used to be like a container. It just had, like, a header row and then all the holds, the active holds listed underneath it. Okay. So. So we basically built like, a container around it, added, like, how many active holds are here, what the total active holds are, and then the most recent date. So basically now it matches, like, the guest folio and the master folio with those containers, because they have the different containers with the same. If there was stuff in here, it had the same information. Okay. Then what we did is we added this little icon, which this is supposed to be blue. I'm pretty sure when there are released holds there, and basically, like, pushing that button is going to open up and display the holds that have been released already. You said that it would be blue if there are active holds. No, it should. If they had released holds, like how this reservation has a released hold on it, that icon, instead of being gray, should have been blue. Okay. And it should be gray. If they don't have any release tools so that they know that they can't even, like, see any because there's nothing to see. Okay. So I'll have to get them to fix that. Okay. But it'll. So basically then it'll pop up. Hilarious. Sneak up on you. So when they open it or they click that little icon, then the release tools will show up in here. And the only thing you can do with these is print a receipt or email a receipt. You Cannot, like, interact with that in. Any other way, Print or email. Okay. Yep. Sorry, I'm just writing this down. Okay, so. Oh, damn. Oh, it's that heavy. Break the chair. Okay, so I'm gonna laugh. I'm just gonna be like, okay, it's time to go home today. Okay, so I just. Because I want to clarify, you probably all know this, but I want to make sure I know this so that I can communicate it if I need to to the team. So when you say that you cannot interact with it any other way, I'm making the assumption that that means if I different screen looking at this, I could interact with it some type of way. Is that why you're saying that or no? You're just saying, like, no. Okay. Not on a different screen. So, like, you see how these are the active folds down here and they've got the skinny snowman. If you click that, you've got receipt, increase, process, release. Like, you have different buttons or different options that you can do to interact with this transaction specifically. Okay. But for the released holds, the only thing you can do is just print or email the receipt. Okay, I see. Like, you can't increase it. You can't release it because it's already been released. You can't charge it because it's been released. Like, we can't guarantee that that money is still being held by the bank or anything like that. Okay. So we don't give you the option to do anything else. Okay. Okay. Why can't I? Why? What's going on? Do you have a charger plugged in another screen? Two seconds. Shut up. You know, they look the same that way. Omar and I are not trying to fight for trying to both look at the screen together. Okay, I'm gonna pull my notes to the screen. Okay. Geez. Who's knocking on the door? Okay, sorry. We're ready now. Wait, Julie, can you hear me? Because I can't hear you. Great. What in the heck just happened? Speaker. Julie, say something now. Okay. Okay. Yeah, now I can hear you. Okay. Okay. I can see your ear. Okay. We'Re here. So anyway, so that's the only thing that you can do with this one is just print the receipt. We also moved the skinny snowman to the top of the container. So if you wanted to, like, select multiple transactions, you can do that from here, whether it's receipt, process, or release. And it will only activate the transactions you're allowed to interact with with these. So, like, for example, if you clicked receipt, you'd be able to click all three of these because you can print a receipt for all three of them. But if you clicked either process or Release, you would only be able to click these bottom two because they're the only two active ones you can't process or release this inactive hold or released hold or whatever you want to call it. Okay. So it almost acts like a filter kind of. Okay. And that's the whole change? Well, I mean kind of the whole change. The only other thing that happened. That's what I want. The only other thing that we did that took development time. I say the only other thing because it doesn't feel like a lot when you're visibly looking at it, but it was a lot of development work. The receipt will now generate as a bold release, which we didn't have that prior to this change. That's good. We got the receipt wiggled out too, so we're good there. But yeah, this is what it'll look like when it comes. When it gets emailed out to the guest. That's gonna be so helpful with just, just that word saying hold, release. Yeah. So like I said, it's not visibly. It doesn't look like a lot. But to make this fix like the default view, I've got to have them fix that and then this icon for sure have to fix that. And we still have a bunch of testing and stuff to do. So. Because like I said, we just got into it like it just hit development last night for the first. Today for the first time like at all ever. So this is developers first attempt at it. Okay. Plans for release. Yeah, that was gonna be my next topic. So we were supposed to go out the 10th, but we are doing a patching event, like a security patching event the 9th and the 10th. So we will not be having a release that week. We will be moving it to the 17th, providing all the rest of our testing goes well and we don't have a lot of changes that we need to make. So I don't know. Wednesday I think. Okay. Yeah, that's a Wednesday night. So realistically it'll show up to the users on the morning of the 18th because it'll go. It has to go out during the maintenance window. And then when will it be in the training environment? Would it be in the training environment before that at all or. No. We should be able to push it earlier because like I said, we were planning on having it done for the Release on the 10th, so we should be able to get it into training that week if. If you want us to. Like a big training. Yeah. Should be something very simple. Okay. Maybe even something we could use the cots for in the property. Okay. In the training team. Okay. Yeah. I think if it's in the training environment, that should work. And then what else is going on that week? Is there something else we're doing that week? We're doing the water park the week before the night. Okay. Yeah. So that week? No. Okay. Anything else with this before we. Omar has the water purpose? I don't think so. Okay. I think that's good. Anything you need to do on your side for Smokey or. Sam? A river ranch for the water park? I don't think so. I think it should be all done. Yeah. I mean, I was over there two weeks ago, did some tests. Everything seems fine. The only one that was coming up without. I may have to check with Morgan again. I think it was employee booking, and. Which was fine because they normally give them that at the front decks, but I believe it was employee booking, all those wild bookings that were coming in. Okay, well, let me know, because like I said, it should be in there, but if it's not, let me know. Yeah. And we can look at it. I do know that just from speaking to the villas, the other issue that they're having that I can't fix, just throwing that out there is interval bookings are being, like. Almost every interval booking is coming through without an account number on it. And some of that's valid because they're not Westgate owners, but the ones that are Westgate owners are coming through without an account number on them, which means they're not getting their vouchers. Thrilled about it. So I don't know if that's something that, like, the reservation team needs to kind of look at or tweak somehow, if they even can, or if we want to revisit whether or not the water park team should be allowed to add vouchers just so that they're. Because, I mean. Yes, they're sending guests all the way back up to the front desk that stand in line and. Yeah. Back to the water park. And it's just kind of a thing. Yeah. But I don't know if you guys want to do that. Yeah. I had a meeting with Brahim and Michael and Gabby even mentioned it at the call today. Yeah. If we could. I can send you an email. I think we should give the managers override access at the water park. They're getting. They're getting a lot because I don't. I don't know if the managers are around enough. I mean, we calmed down there for a little bit, and there wasn't a manager around anywhere. Do they have supervisors like they do? Right? I don't know, but I don't. I think the people that we were talking to that we saw over there while we were there were just agents. And I know that that's a conversation of sorts, whether or not that's something that you guys want to do. But let me. Let me. Let me talk to them again. Maybe we'll do the managers and supervisors. You're right. The managers aren't really around, but I think they have supervisors. Well, but we only have one water park role, so if we add the option to allow them to add vouchers or entries to the water park roll, then it's kind of an all or nothing for any. For whoever has that water park roll. Oh, okay. Yeah. So just a thought, but I. I can almost guarantee you that this same problem is going to happen at the lakes. Yeah. And going back and forth is also kind of gonna suck. It will. When Gabby mentioned it today, Juliana said the same thing, so it will. Yeah. Let me talk to the managers. I mean, I wonder if we could just. Let me talk to them. I'll send you an email. Yeah, let me know. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Just whenever you guys decide what you want to do, whatever that is, just shoot me an email so that we can. A lot of the interval communications and stuff. I don't know if there's a way that from a reservation perspective, if he can know that they're an owner or get any additional information so that we can recognize them as an owner somehow and put that owner account number on their booking. And then that way it just solves the problem. But I don't know what intervals sends during their booking process to know whether or not that's something we can do. So I do know that they're aware, though. I got an email from Diane regarding and collecting owners that are booking outside of their week that are getting benefits. So I know they're aware like that their reservation coming in where they're owners, but they're booking differently and the. The screen is not showing or the reservation is not showing that they're actual owners. So I know they're looking for a way to fix that. I'm not sure where they are with that. So what does fix that mean? What does fix that mean? Oh, that was my Jamaican verbiage. You're looking for a way to. To fix the situation. Right. But does that mean you want to give tickets or entries to people who Aren't staying within the rules or you there's an issue for to change the rules. I guess it's a little bit of both. So let me. So there's two things going on right now on the. That email specifically for wow was because they do not want to give anyone that is booking outside of their. I guess outside of their week conversation happening with Jared and Peter where we're trying to figure out if someone, if an owner book through Expedia or outside of their week, should they still be getting owner's benefit Currently at the properties we are. If owner booked through Expedia and they say hey I'm the owner, they can prove it. We're giving them the water park pass. But that conversation is happening right now to see if that's something we're going to change. Yeah. So you're gonna have to. If that change is that if there's an owner account number on the reservation, it's getting entries just in the go because that was the business rule. Yeah. But when we also stood out there, we watched people come up with their bold black owner's cards, show the card and get a band. Didn't touch the tablet at all. Yeah, yeah. I, yeah, I'm hope, I'm hoping that it has a change that's going to be a lot for owners, that it's going to be a big change because everyone that is an owner, what are they booked for? Xp? They're, they've, they're used to getting their benefits. That's going to be big. So I explained all of that to Peter. So we'll see, we'll see what they decide. We're going to have to have a conversation, Sam, and about source and origins and what the front desk is allowed to book versus what they're not allowed to book versus what the system's gonna, you know, kind of stop and not allow them to book versus training an sop, what they're gonna be able to book. If that makes sense. Yeah. So like in NMR right now, technically a front desk agent can book whatever they want and it's an SOP slash training as to what they book versus what they don't book. When it's. When it comes to ftc, because we're building it, we can make some adjustments I think just based off previous conversations and if it changes, it changes. But based off previous conversations, either the reservations team or LOSI is not going to want the front desk booking certain Source Norton, certain types of reservations. And I think some of that's going to get A little gray when we start talking about, like, interval RCI and how some of those resorts book them based off of, like, faxes or emails and stuff. Yeah. So I think there's going to be some conversation there or maybe creating some different source and origins to accommodate for that or something. So we'll be. We'll have to obviously talk through all of that. And I'm gonna start with just you and Losi. Okay. And see. Which is super weird, but. So that's what we're doing. Yeah. But we may need to get Stephen at some point involved. But. Yeah, but I think that's a good start with me and Losi. Yeah. We got to talk about date restrictions, Sam. Like how many nights we're going to allow everybody to book or not book per reservation. Just make sure we're still on the same page there and then how far in advance we're going to allow the front desk to book those reservations. Okay. If it's going to be a couple weeks, couple days, couple months, I don't think it should be a couple of years. No. Just saying there's going to be limits. We just have to kind of nail those down a little bit. So I'm going to try to set up a call for next week. Okay. We don't have the IT office right now because it's undergoing renovations and stuff like that. So it'll be over teams. Okay. But we'll figure it out. Long of reservation screen and I literally went, no, we. We won't be doing this. It takes too much time. There's too many clicks. You guys would have like a. It would not be. It would take way too long. The bread does. That's what. That's where part of my problem and training rentals come to do those training or no. Yes. Yeah. I mean, we could just duplicate the training, but then it's just too difficult. Like, that's why those trainings are like weeks long. And I mean, this is one part of it, but that's why those trainings are weeks long. So. Yeah, yeah, it's. It's too many screens. There's too many buttons. There's too many. There's too many rules. There's. Oh, it's just too much. So we won't be doing that thing feels so clunky and I just. No. Anyway, figure out how you feel about it. And that's probably after I beat him up a little bit for being honest. So. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Sam. But yeah, I think other than that, that was everything that I had. Is there anything that you guys needed from us right now? No. I don't think so. No, we just. You mentioned it, like, a little earlier about Sam. Like when you all were at one at the Villas, they were just kind of like giving out the bands, right? Attempt to do some type of reinforcement. They were trained. They know how many plans to go out there. Okay, we did one. You're like, you're done. You're done. Okay, well, we will. I will try to make sure. So part of what we're. We started to do is we're doing these things called observations. And so we're doing them in every functional area. Right. And so I'll make sure that they go out and do an observation sometime in the next two weeks in that area to see if that's still happening. And if anything, I'll go back to the leader and say, hey, so funny. Enough, I did went out there. I think I went out there to the villas the day after you guys were there, because I was talking to Enrique and he's like, hey, there were two ladies here. And so I was watching him, and he's the one that has been there. He'd be like, oh, yep, here you go. How many you need? Yeah, okay. Okay. Yeah, I'll let is water park in the data. I need to put observation for them. Did he create one? No, there's housekeeping, engineering, front office, security. Okay. Yeah, we'll work on sometime in the next two weeks getting out and doing some observations there just to see if some of those things are still happening. And I'll let you guys know. And then I'll also follow up with Javier if they're still happening. Okay, cool. Anything else. For any documentation and stuff that you do for the hold release? Um, before you take screenshots of stuff, just let us know. So. Because, like, there's a couple of things in there that we talked about that icon color and some stuff. I just want to make sure that gets corrected before we go in and take any screenshots or pictures, because I want to make sure that they're right. Obviously, I would say.","📅 **Meeting Overview**: This meeting primarily focused on the recent changes made to the billing screen of the reservation system and discussed potential issues and upcoming releases.

So we don't give the option to do anything else. Okay. Why can't I? Why? What's going on? Because you have a charger plugged in. Another screen. Two seconds. Shut up. You know, they look the same that way. Omar and I are not trying to fight for trying to both look at the screen together. Okay, from. I'm gonna pull my notes to the screen. Okay. Jeez. Who's knocking on the door? Okay, sorry. We're ready now. Wait, Julie, can you hear me? Because I can't hear you. Great. What in the heck just happened? Speaker. Julie, say something now. Okay, yeah, now I can hear you. Okay. Okay, I can see your ear. Okay. We'Re here. So anyway, so that's the only thing that you can do with this one, is just print the receipt. We also moved the skinny snowman to the top of the container. So if you wanted to, like, select multiple transactions, you can do that from here, whether it's receipt, process, or release. And it will only activate the transactions you're allowed to interact with with these. So, like, for example, if you clicked Receipt, you'd be able to click all three of these because you could print receipt for all three of them. But if you click either process or release, you would only be able to click these bottom two because they're the only two active ones you can't process or release this inactive hold or released hold or whatever you want to call it. Okay. So it almost acts like a filter. Okay. Kind of. Okay. And that's the whole change? Well, I mean, kind of a whole change. The only other thing that happened. That's. My month. The only other thing that we did that took development time. I say the only other thing because, you know, it doesn't feel like a lot when you're visibly looking at it. But it was a lot of development work. The receipt will now generate as a hold release, which we didn't have that prior to this change. So that's good. We got the receipt wiggled out too. So good there. Okay. But yeah, this is what it'll look like when it comes when it gets emailed out to the guest. That's going to be so helpful with just. Just that word saying whole release. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. So like I said, it's not visibly. It doesn't look like a lot. But to make this happen is. Has been a bunch of work. And we obviously still have a couple things we gotta fix, like the default view. I'VE gotta have them fix that. And then this icon for sure have to fix that. And we still have a bunch of testing and stuff to do, so. Because like I said, we just got into it. It just hit development last night for the first. Today for the first time at all ever. So developers, first attempt at it. Okay. Plans for release. Yeah, that was gonna be my next topic. So we were supposed to go out the 10th, but we are doing a patching event, like a security patching event, the 9th and the 10th. So we will not be having a release that week. We will be moving it to the 17th, providing all the rest of our testing goes well and we don't have a lot of changes that we need to make. I don't know. Wednesday, I think.","📅 **Meeting Overview**: The meeting focused on discussing recent developments and changes related to transaction processing and receipt handling. Technical updates, testing status, and release plans were key areas of focus.

🎯 **Key Decisions Made**:
- The receipt will now include a ""hold release"" label for better clarity.
- The release scheduled for the 10th is postponed to the 17th due to a security patching event.
- Further testing is required before finalizing the release.

📋 **Action Items**:
- Fix the default view and icon issues - Owner: Development Team, Deadline: Before the next release on 17th.
- Complete testing of the new functionalities - Owner: Quality Assurance Team, Deadline: Before the 17th.
- Prepare documentation and communicate changes to stakeholders - Owner: Project Manager, Deadline: By the release date.

💡 **Important Discussions**:
- The screen interface now allows for selecting multiple transactions, which will only show active transactions for processing.
- Although changes aren't visually significant, they required substantial development effort.
- The added ""hold release"" on receipts is expected to improve guest communication and processing clarity.

⚠️ **Risks & Issues**:
- Potential delays if further issues are discovered during testing.
- Risk of user confusion if interface issues (default view and icons) are not addressed before the release.
  
📅 **Next Meeting/Follow-up**:
- A follow-up meeting to assess testing outcomes and readiness for the revised release is recommended before the 17th release. Prepare testing feedback and any additional issues for discussion.","[{""title"": ""Fix default view and icon issues"", ""dueDate"": ""2025-09-05"", ""assignee"": null, ""category"": ""development"", ""priority"": ""high"", ""description"": ""Resolve issues with the default view and specific icon in the system.

Different properties, whatever. There's updates being posted to SharePoint and you want Frontline people to get those updates in an email or on teams or in a teams channel so they don't have to actually go to the SharePoint site because they, you know, they spend their time in teams. Correct. So what I've done is so agents can run just so I don't know how familiar with Power Automate flows. Like a Power Automate flow can run on a schedule and agents can do the same thing. Okay. So an agent can have a trigger that is a recurring trigger and that's what I've added here. Okay. So I've added a recurring profile trigger and I can send you screenshots of this. I've actually, I thought this was an interesting concept. So I'm actually, I'm going to put a. I have to. Like on LinkedIn as well how to do this. You know, when I thought of it, I'm like, this gotta be out there somewhere because it's so convenient for like, you know, like I oversee the front office and they're just the information. There's so many changes throughout the day and when they're. They're doing checking, they don't have time to go into their email. So just having that read out on the program they have open is just so convenient. So. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. And there's not really a whole lot out there. There's a learn article on proactive messaging, but it doesn't really. I don't think it explains the. The how and not necessarily tying it to the what and the why. Okay. So yeah, I am gonna put this up on LinkedIn probably next week at some point. I kind of the walkthrough. But I'll share the content with you before I do that so you can at least see what this looks like. I'll share scre. Perfect. I would just share the solution file, but I'm not allowed to do that. No worries. So we've got a recurring copilot trigger here. So if I open that up, it's. It's essentially power. This is a power automate flow that is triggering the agent. And I've set it up to be a recurring. I've got it every day at 8am you can make that as frequent or as infrequent as you want. Or we can make this. You can give an agent multiple triggers. Right. So agent doesn't need to just have one. Right. So I just added it as a recurring trigger. But if you wanted to say like, hey, Every time some. It has to be something traceable. Okay. So like. Okay, so if in. And. And I have let me go to my terrible SharePoint set here that I set up on. Not this one. Where is it? Oh, this one is the news site. So this is just super basic, just using it, the poc. But I basically added. Added some posts to the recent updates and news section. So you could. As long as, like as long as there's a Power Automate trigger for a certain type of file being added or a certain type of news, like a post. I'm not familiar enough with SharePoint to know what, like what this. This exact thing is called. Like these articles or posts, right. Like if there's a trigger there that you could look in your Power Automate and see like get specific. Like every time a new post is put up or every time something changes in SharePoint, you could actually trigger based off of that as well. Okay, but I just basically did and let me. I'm working on like 10 different things here, so bear with me. Yeah, here's our agent. So I just basically have it set up on recurrence. But if you can find a different trigger that you think would be helpful, you can trigger the same agent off of multiple triggers. You can add as many as you want. Okay. So the way that this is set up, it's recurring. I have it set up every day and then I'm sending this message to the agent. Essentially all this is saying is when this agent gets kicked off, this is the same as sending a prompt into the agent. Correct. I'm basically sending this prompt that says get the latest updates from SharePoint. And then I'm not saying anything after that because what comes after that is managed by. In the agent itself. So I've got instructions that say use knowledge of the latest updates. And I told the focus only on Office related updates. Like I was trying to get to focus on what. What was in that. Like I just have like some random Office update type things that are in here. Like there's a pizza party, like offices are closed, whatever. Like that. That type of latest update stuff. I don't know exactly what would be in yours. It's that. That was the concept I was doing. Right. Okay. So I pulled the focus on that and then I built out two tools to do the actual sending of this through teams. So this is like super, super basic. Like the. The all. Like the agent is really managing the bulk of this. Like it is going to the SharePoint side figuring out what's new. And I. And Sorry, one other thing before we go. There is I gave it knowledge, which is Fair point. I think I saw that you had already done like similar things here. So I added knowledge and I added in SharePoint and I gave it the SharePoint site. Okay. I gave it the whole site. And. Yeah, okay. So then I added. Right now it's being triggered by a schedule that's basically just prompting it to kick off. And then we're saying use knowledge to get your latest updates. I'm telling you to focus on that Office Red stuff. Then without. Usually in Power Automate, you have to go and define a variable that says, hey, this is a. This is an input. This is an output. Define it. You don't necessarily have to do that. I'm letting the orchestrator. I'm telling the orchestrator essentially take what you get out of step one and use it as an input for this step here, which is going to be this agent flow tool. I'll go through this real quick that I know you have to drop. This is an agent flow, which is. And what this is doing is it's taking an input, which I gave it this input. But I'm not telling you what to do with this. The agent's figuring out that the latest updates goes to the latest updates. It's going to put that text into here. And then I'm telling it to post it in a chat or a channel. The message is here, the latest update since yesterday. And then the variable is the one from the initiating step. And that's essentially it. Right. And for. In this example, I've hardcoded it to one person. You could use groups and stuff like that as well. The only thing with using groups is that it's actually not sounding a big deal, but like, everyone that is in the recipient list has to have this agent installed in teams or it will just skip. Makes sense. Yeah. So. And then what it ends up looking like is, let's go over here. And I actually just. I haven't reinstalled it. Let me go see if it's over here. All right, there you are. So it hasn't sent anything new to me because I just had to reinstall because I updated it. We can see what it looks like in the channels. I go over to my channels. So here's in a channel, what it looks like. Okay. Okay. I mean, essentially the same thing. Do you want to jump back on A four? Yeah. I mean, maybe we could jump back on and I could build it out a little bit on my side. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yep. Okay, yeah, let's do that. Let's do that. I know it's late, but let's spend at least a few minutes at four and then try and come back. I'll just move this meeting there so I can, I don't forget. I appreciate it, man. Thank you. But, yeah, it's, yeah, it's an interesting, interesting concept. The only thing that, like, you're gonna have to test. I noticed that, like, you'll have to do some manipulation of the prompt to tell it. What, what exactly. Yeah, yeah. What, what stuff you're interested in it spinning out because, like, in the, like you can see here, like, I, I created this a while ago when I was messing around with it, and it keeps sending the same stuff. Now, granted, I didn't add anything new, but I haven't really defined like, what is the latest update? Is it only things that are from today? Is it things from yesterday? Is it things from a week ago? That's all stuff that you'll have to play around with the instructions on to see how it handles it. But yeah, I mean, the concept I think is there. It's just to do some testing to figure it out. Okay, now what. This is, this is, this is awesome, man. I appreciate you taking the time and really looking into it and putting this together. This is way further than what me and Steph was able to come up with. So this is awesome. Yep, yep. And like I said, I'm gonna, I'll send you, I am gonna post it on LinkedIn. I'm gonna send you the draft that I have going. Okay. Process and you'll be able to, you should be able to follow that and perfect. And build it out yourself. And then like, I'm really interested to hear because I, like, sometimes I build these things and I'm just like, okay, let's just get it to work and hammer it through. But there's like, I don't know your full use case or like the full data stuff that you're working with. So I don't know how helpful or not helpful it will be once you actually light it up. Got it. So I'm interested to see how it works and how we can manipulate the instructions to get it to actually spit out information. That's helpful. Definitely. Yeah, we can definitely provide some feedback. Yeah. Okay, cool. I'm going to move to the floor and we can talk through it. Okay, sounds good. Thank you. Bye. That was really good. I could set it up to trigger like every. I'm going on. So I, I, I, I, I, I Agree. Yeah. Hey, Omar. Hey, Omar. Hey. Hey, hey. Okay, I'm over here talking and my mic is muted. Hey, guys. Yes, I'm sorry. As I was said in dry. I decided to call an impromptu meeting because Diane is just all over this. I love it. Not. She's not pausing. So we have to get this going so we can present it to. Lisa's waiting on it. When she gets back next week, she's. Going to question too. So not d. And then we're done with electricity. Yeah. We know how much to provide for that sort of thing. So you're good with us just kind of doing a run through of what we have so far? Yeah. Yes. Yeah. All right. I think you have the notes, Omar. So you're it. You're it. Did I put it in the meeting in the last meeting? Where did I save it? I know I had shared it with. You guys. In your office. Hold up. I don't think we updated anything last week. Right. We just had a talk to them. So let me find that note. Let me see how it's. Basically. I think basically I have a little bit of some notes, but I think basically it was that program to research a program that we could use. The owner would check in at the front desk. We agree that the front desk would give them the token. That's the start of this initiative. Token or certificate. We have written down to start while we get a token created. Because a token can slow us down if I don't know how quick we. Can get that done. Like a welcome home token. We can get a welcome home certificate. I know that. Yeah, we can get tokens. We can buy tokens online and have them printed. So I will do token and then we can say for a backup if we. If they decide you need to start this tomorrow. There we go. Okay. But for now, we are going to be using this in space of the token. Perfect. I do know that the idea came apart also after talking with Diane about them just showing their. What you call it, their QR code. We didn't really talk much about it. But again, if I check in, if they don't. All right. So if I'm an owner, I check in. Front desk would not tell me anything about it. Then I would. My next tell me that we have complementary photos for owners with the characters. And when they go there, they need to show their QR code. That would require whoever is at the character to have something to read their. An app to read their QR code as opposed to just ending the. The handler are token. Yeah. And I'm not sure if they're scanning. This was. Yeah. So at the end of the day, we saw 40 after that and said, okay, if you're a platinum, then.","📅 **Meeting Overview**: The meeting focused on leveraging Power Automate for updating frontline workers with information from SharePoint without them needing to visit the website directly. Additionally, a new initiative involving a 'welcome home' token system for owners checking in at the front desk was discussed.

🎯 **Key Decisions Made**:
- Implement a recurring trigger using Power Automate to notify agents about SharePoint updates through Teams.
- Test and refine the Power Automate solution to ensure it meets office needs.
- Proceed with a 'welcome home' token system to enhance guest experience during check-ins. Certificates will act as a temporary alternative until tokens are ready.

📋 **Action Items**:
1. **Recipient**: Diane  
   **Task**: Prepare and post the Power Automate walkthrough on LinkedIn; share draft with colleagues beforehand.
   **Deadline**: Next week
  
2. **Recipient**: Unspecified Team Member  
   **Task**: Order 'welcome home' tokens online; make arrangements to use certificates as a temporary solution.
   **Deadline**: Prior to the start of the program
  
3. **Recipient**: Omar  
   **Task**: Send out drafted notes and further refine the strategy using feedback received.
  
💡 **Important Discussions**:
- Power Automate can be customized with multiple triggers and recurring schedules, increasing flexibility in how updates are delivered.
- The introduction of the token system as a way to build a more personalized check-in experience, with discussions on how QR codes could further enhance this.

⚠️ **Risks & Issues**:
- Potential issuance with ensuring all team members have the necessary agents installed in Teams.
- The replacement of tokens with certificates if the ordering is delayed, impacting the planned start of the initiative.
- Technical challenges in integrating QR code scanning with on-site character photo sessions.

📅 **Next Meeting/Follow-up**:
- Reconvene briefly today at 4 PM to run through any lingering issues and confirm the readiness of the Power Automate solution.
- Prepare a full demonstration of the initiative to be ready for presentation upon Lisa's return.","[{""title"": ""Post Power Automate flow walkthrough on LinkedIn"", ""dueDate"": ""2025-09-04"", ""assignee"": null, ""category"": ""other"", ""priority"": ""medium"", ""description"": ""Share a detailed post on LinkedIn about the Power Automate flow with the recurring profile trigger, including screenshots and explanations.

And then the closing activity is building the WOW chain together. So I'm going to hand each participant a slip of construction paper and I want them to write one way they can support WOW in their role. Something that you can do to elevate guest loyalty in your day to day. Then I'm going to call each of them up to the front and we're going to make a chain together. We're going to make a paper chain together. So are you going to explain how each area affect wow? Are you going to go deep into those explanation? No, because I don't think I know that answer. Okay, so maybe I could follow up with. Maybe your 45 minutes is just focus on like all the front office and how wow. Like there's not much to talk about how WOW affect. So I mean I could talk about the script and making sure that we're recognizing them and you know, it's when we recognize them, it gives them that whatever, I'll come up with something. But it makes them feel important, it makes them feel valued and that they make the right decision. Like I could, you know, start off by saying that and, and I don't know how I could tie it in. I mean I could tie it in because that first interaction really set the tone for everything else. Psychotic, somewhat like that. And then kind of follow yours. Like, you know, when they go here, they already know. When they go to fnb, they already know because they were told by the front decks. Whatever, whatever, whatever. You really, your team really sets the tone. Right. So I could probably do that. But that's, that's not enough. You don't think so, you don't think we can like come up with something? I mean I can, I can definitely come up with something. I just, just gonna be up there talking, which is just. Bo. What'S your topic? It is. Let me send it to you. Can you just tell me? I'm type it really quick. Elevating guest loyalty through personalized experience. And then I could give you that description. I don't like her description. So you're gonna give her a new one. Let's do my magic over here for a second. Give me a second chat GPT. That's what I was gonna do. And then find some topics related more to Westgate and then just build off that. But if you already have stuff on the wall. That's what I'm saying. Like if I have stuff out, I feel like you could. The Problem is I had this idea, but that's us really depending on them coming through with the Right. The right. Like what if I'm not going to get around to talking about all the areas of opportunity. Right. But if at the check in you end up with all the like, let's say like every group ends up with like two or three things that check in that they think there's an opportunity we can improve on, that literally sets you up for success. But we're banking on the fact that they can't come up with those. Right. Which makes me nervous. Like if they don't come up with areas of opportunity for the front office. Like what, what are you, what do you expect them to come up with? Pivot in the moment. Do you have ambassadors? Are there front desk ambassadors? I think they are. Yeah. Maybe. Okay, so maybe here's what I would expect the front desk ambassador to come up with if just based on. Remember, I don't have enough. I don't have all the working knowledge that all of you have. But I would imagine that a front desk ambassador is going to come up with the fact that there's a. There's an issue when it comes to systems because everything I need for loyalty is not in FTC. So when I have a line of 400 check ins waiting in the lobby and I'm needing to go back and forth between screens and toggle to loyalty console to find out information that I need to find out and I also need to check people in a timely manner. Right. Like, do you think that's an issue that would arise? I see that as an issue. But like, do they see that as an issue? Well, we don't. The ambassadors, the frontex agent, like, they don't, they don't do anything extra for. While I check in. So if I'm an owner and I check in and I. What's the script? This is different for owners and I guess. Yeah. Okay, what's the script for owners? It's like a four part script. There's a recognition section. You know, thank you for being a loyal member or thank you for being a platinum member. So there's the recognition. Then the second part of the script is reminding them where to use their credit. Okay. That they can go to the FNB outlets to use their credit reminding of the credit, then reminding them how to get to it on their phone. Okay. On reminding them about like the QR code. What if one of your wow Ambassadors says the script takes too long? I haven't had that problem yet. Since we roll it out. No, because they don't. They don't look for credits. They don't. This is. While they're typing. They're just, like, talking, you know? If I'm an owner and I say, can you look at my credits? They don't have a way to look at it right now. I thought they did in loyalty contract console, I thought that's why they have. I was told by your friend desk leaders that they have access to loyalty console. Yeah. Most of the supervisors or most agents don't. Some may do, like, some of the older agents, but. Yeah, but if they're asked to look at it, they're probably gonna send them to the app. Most. Most agents don't at the bigger properties. I don't think any agent does, like Christine. And there's older agents that have been there. They may have it, but the other agents, they don't have. Maybe that's something that they call out as an area of opportunity. Like I don't have access to know exactly what the credits are that that person has. Yeah, but I don't want to give that to them at the bigger property. That won't work. No. When you have a 800 line, 400 people in line, it takes a while to go in the loyalty council. It's a lot of clicks in the loyalty council to get to it. Well, that's where the problem lies, because it's on the loyalty council and it's not an ftc. Yeah, but could you see that coming up as an issue? Oh, yeah. They're gonna. They're gonna ask about it being in fdc, and we. We just had a talk with it, me and Joanna, and that's probably not coming for now because.","📅 **Meeting Overview**:
